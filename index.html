		Cisco is providing an update for the ongoing investigation into observed exploitation of the web UI feature in Cisco IOS XE Software. We are updating the list of fixed releases and adding the Software Checker. Our investigation has determined that the actors exploited two previously unknown issues. The attacker first exploited CVE-2023-20198 to gain initial access and issued a privilege 15 command to create a local user and password combination. This allowed the user to log in with normal user access. The attacker then exploited another component of the web UI feature, leveraging the new local user to elevate privilege to root and write the implant to the file system. Cisco has assigned CVE-2023-20273 to this issue. CVE-2023-20198 has been assigned a CVSS Score of 10.0. CVE-2023-20273 has been assigned a CVSS Score of 7.2. Both of these CVEs are being tracked by CSCwh87343.

In case you missed it (because I did): On 02 November, **Cisco** updated their
blog post about the actively exploited zero-days CVE-2023-20198 and
CVE-2023-20273, stating that they identified a new version of the implant, now
called BadCandy, and added expected response from the new version of the
implant against one of the HTTP requests used to check for infected device.

Cisco Talos has published a technical analysis of BadCandy, the implant
deployed on Cisco IOS XE routers via the two recent zero-days CVE-2023-20198
and CVE-2023-20273: [https://blog.talosintelligence.com/active-exploitation-
of-cisco-ios-xe-software/](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/active-
exploitation-of-cisco-ios-xe-software/)

Talos says the malware is now at v3, showing that threat actors are still
actively modifying their attacks and malware to maintain access to the
compromised boxes. The latest v3 modifications appear to have worked, as
Shadowserver has stopped detecting infected systems:

		A vulnerability in the web services interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute certain unauthorized configuration commands on a Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) device that is managed by the FMC Software. This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization of configuration commands that are sent through the web service interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the FMC web services interface and sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute certain configuration commands on the targeted FTD device. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid credentials on the FMC Software.

		<p class=description>
		The Java OpenWire protocol marshaller is vulnerable to Remote Code 
Execution. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker with network 
access to either a Java-based OpenWire broker or client to run arbitrary
 shell commands by manipulating serialized class types in the OpenWire 
protocol to cause either the client or the broker (respectively) to 
instantiate any class on the classpath.

Users are recommended to upgrade
 both brokers and clients to version 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, or 5.18.3 
which fixes this issue.

clients and protocols like AMQP, MQTT, OpenWire, and STOMP.

The flaw in question is CVE-2023-46604, a critical severity (CVSS v3 score:
10.0) RCE that allows attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands by
exploiting class types in the OpenWire protocol.

According to Apache's disclosure on October 27, 2023, this vulnerability
affects the following Apache ActiveMQ and Legacy OpenWire Module versions:

  * Versions before 5.18.3 in the 5.18.x series
  * Versions before 5.17.6 in the 5.17.x series
  * Versions before 5.16.7 in the 5.16.x series
  * All versions before 5.15.16

To address this issue, fixes have been released in versions 5.15.16, 5.16.7,

"⚠️ Critical RCE Alert: 3,000 Apache ActiveMQ Servers at Risk! ⚠️"

Over 3,000 Apache ActiveMQ servers are exposed online, vulnerable to a
critical RCE flaw (CVE-2023-46604, CVSS v3: 10.0). Immediate patching is urged
to prevent potential data theft and network compromise. Stay vigilant! 🛡️💻

Apache ActiveMQ is an open-source message broker for secure communication
between clients and servers, supporting Java and various cross-language
clients and protocols like AMQP, MQTT, OpenWire, and STOMP.

The flaw in question is CVE-2023-46604, a critical severity (CVSS v3 score:
10.0) RCE that allows attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands by
exploiting class types in the OpenWire protocol.

According to Apache's disclosure on October 27, 2023, this vulnerability
affects the following Apache ActiveMQ and Legacy OpenWire Module versions:

  * Versions before 5.18.3 in the 5.18.x series
  * Versions before 5.17.6 in the 5.17.x series
  * Versions before 5.16.7 in the 5.16.x series
  * All versions before 5.15.16

To address this issue, fixes have been released in versions 5.15.16, 5.16.7,
5.17.6, and 5.18.3. It's recommended to upgrade to one of these versions to
enhance your IT security.

In our classic sensor network (we're still wiring up our 10x improved sensors
to the data machine) we've caught one IP attempting to find and pwn Apache
ActiveMQ (CVE-2023-46604) kit.

Message queues should never be wired up to the big scary internet. Use
WireGuard/Tailscale if you have to do remote queue ops.

[#confluence](https://infosec.exchange/tags/confluence)
[#ransomware](https://infosec.exchange/tags/ransomware) as a result of
[#cve202322518](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202322518)

1\. Dont run Jira or Confluence as root on the linux box. (Good advice for any
web app).

2\. Install the database on a different machine from the web server. Even if
your web server gets compromised and encrypted the data in Jira will remain
safe and recoverable.

3\. Encrypt the database tables for added protection against data theft.

4\. Keep multiple daily server backups / snapshots so you can recover from a
clean backup.

5\. Monitor outbound traffic for spikes realted to data exfiltration.

6\. Monitor CPU for spikes that might represent encryption activity.

MOST IMPORTANT - DONT RUN Atlassian products on the open Internet!

Since [@pdnuclei](https://bird.makeup/users/pdnuclei) has posted a full PoC
for [#cve202346747](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202346747) already, we've
updated our blog post at [https://www.praetorian.com/blog/refresh-
compromising-f5-big-ip-with-request-smuggling-
cve-2023-46747/](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/refresh-compromising-f5-big-
ip-with-request-smuggling-cve-2023-46747/) with all the technical details.

Kudos to [@rootxharsh](https://bird.makeup/users/rootxharsh) and
[@iamnoooob](https://bird.makeup/users/iamnoooob) for SUCH a quick
reproduction of the bug as well!

A warning for folks who are going to start spraying this around though:

The process of abusing AJP request smuggling causes Tomcat and Apache to get
out of sync. So as you send more of these requests, the de-sync gets worse.
Eventually the server gets so out of sync that it becomes incapable of
actually serving the correct site once you ask for it.

During testing we regularly would get our F5-BIGIP so jammed up that it was
just faster to do a full server reboot than it was to wait for things to clear
out normally. There's a secondary bug here in that if you do this enough,
you'll eventually catch the login session of someone else trying to hit the
server, but given the fact that you can get RCE through this as well, it seems
not to be as huge of a deal.

I do hope folks patched though - if you weren't paying attention on
Thursday/Friday you're gonna get snuck by this one pretty badly. A 72 hour
window isn't a massive amount of time unfortunately.

For what it's worth, at a glance there wasn't anything SUPER insane exposed on
the internet when we did a check. We did find one cisa.gov server, which we
notified them about and it was taken down before the ball started rolling on
this stuff. Lots and lots of telecoms though.

cve-2023-46747/](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/refresh-compromising-f5-big-
ip-with-request-smuggling-cve-2023-46747/) with all the technical details.

Kudos to [@rootxharsh](https://bird.makeup/users/rootxharsh) and
[@iamnoooob](https://bird.makeup/users/iamnoooob) for SUCH a quick
reproduction of the bug as well!

A warning for folks who are going to start spraying this around though:

The process of abusing AJP request smuggling causes Tomcat and Apache to get
out of sync. So as you send more of these requests, the de-sync gets worse.
Eventually the server gets so out of sync that it becomes incapable of
actually serving the correct site once you ask for it.

During testing we regularly would get our F5-BIGIP so jammed up that it was
just faster to do a full server reboot than it was to wait for things to clear
out normally. There's a secondary bug here in that if you do this enough,
you'll eventually catch the login session of someone else trying to hit the
server, but given the fact that you can get RCE through this as well, it seems
not to be as huge of a deal.

I do hope folks patched though - if you weren't paying attention on
Thursday/Friday you're gonna get snuck by this one pretty badly. A 72 hour
window isn't a massive amount of time unfortunately.

For what it's worth, at a glance there wasn't anything SUPER insane exposed on
the internet when we did a check. We did find one cisa.gov server, which we
notified them about and it was taken down before the ball started rolling on
this stuff. Lots and lots of telecoms though.

[@itnewsbot](https://schleuss.online/@itnewsbot) Just for your information:

CISA added both CVE-2023-46747 and CVE-2023-46748 to the Known Exploited
Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog the same day, based on evidence of exploitation.
The F5 security advisory contains CVE-2023-46748 indicators of compromise to
look for.

Well, that didn't take long.
[#cve202346747](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202346747) has now been
reported by F5 as being exploited in the wild. This can be found in an updated
section of the advisory towards the bottom at
[https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353).

Interestingly enough, the in-the-wild exploitation is using the SQL injection
vulnerability (CVE-2023-46748) in conjunction with the AJP request smuggling
attack to achieve access. This vulnerability was also included in the same KB
advisory as the AJP request smuggling attack.

Originally I wasn't sure if the SQL injection vuln report was the other
security researcher(s) who had also reported the AJP Request Smuggling content
to F5, but given the way this is being exploited in the wild it sure looks
like this is the case.

🚪 Alert: 'Effluence' Backdoor Persists Despite Patching Atlassian Confluence
Servers  
➥ [@thehackernews](https://infosec.exchange/@thehackernews)

The web shell, made up of a loader and payload, is passive, allowing requests
to pass through it unnoticed until a request matching a specific parameter is
provided, at which point it triggers its malicious behavior by executing a
series of actions.

 **Aon** identified a unique Atlassian Confluence backdoor that persists even
after patching CVE-2023-22515. It grants persistent remote access to every web
page on the server, including the unauthenticated login page, without the need
for a valid user account. The web shell (dubbed "Effluence") is passive,
allowing requests to pass through it unnoticed until a request matching a
specific parameter is provided, at which point it triggers its malicious
behavior by executing a series of actions. No IOC, but detection methods and
YARA Rule provided.

🚪 Alert: 'Effluence' Backdoor Persists Despite Patching Atlassian Confluence
Servers  
➥ [@thehackernews](https://infosec.exchange/@thehackernews)

The web shell, made up of a loader and payload, is passive, allowing requests
to pass through it unnoticed until a request matching a specific parameter is
provided, at which point it triggers its malicious behavior by executing a
series of actions.

 **Aon** identified a unique Atlassian Confluence backdoor that persists even
after patching CVE-2023-22515. It grants persistent remote access to every web
page on the server, including the unauthenticated login page, without the need
for a valid user account. The web shell (dubbed "Effluence") is passive,
allowing requests to pass through it unnoticed until a request matching a
specific parameter is provided, at which point it triggers its malicious
behavior by executing a series of actions. No IOC, but detection methods and
YARA Rule provided.

The security team at consulting firm AON has published an analysis of
Effluence, a backdoor planted on Atlassian Confluence servers that have been
exploited using the CVE-2023-22515 vulnerability.

The zero-day was used by a suspected Chinese APT (Storm-0062) in limited
attacks since mid-September. AON did not attribute the backdoor to any threat
actor yet.

 **ASEC** summarized 17 months of a Kimsuky operation dubbed _Operation Covert
Stalker_. Kimsuky is a nation-state APT attributed to North Korea and assessed
to be in the Reconnaissance General Burueau (RGB). In the report (Korean
language only) ASEC states that Kimsuky sends phishing emails to targets
involved in the field of North Korea, exploiting CVE-2019-0708 (9.8 critical
RDP vulnerability allowing for RCE, added to KEV Catalog 03 November 2021) and
other unidentified vulnerabilities, adding remote control programs e.g.
AnyDesk and Quasar RAT etc., and encrypting systems with BlackBit ransomware.

 **Aqua** reports that Kinsing threat actors are exploiting CVE-2023-4911 (7.8
high severity, disclosed 03 October 2023 by Qualsys) dubbed "Looney Tunables"
to breach cloud environments. CVE-2017-9841 (9.8 critical, PHPUnit RCE
vulnerability disclosed 19 November 2017) is first leveraged for initial
access. The end goal of the attack appears to be to extract credentials
associated with the cloud service provider for follow-on attacks. Aqua states
that the threat actor has been actively involved in cryptojacking operations.

Looking for some community input on this one, because I am a bit confused.
Could someone explain CVE-2022-23166 to me? I'm not looking to figure out how
to exploit it, but I am trying to get a better idea on what could happen. If
an endpoint has the Sysaid agent installed, does that mean there is a URL tied
that asset? Is that what this CVE is referring to? Any insight would be very
helpful because I want to protect against this, but I need to be able to
explain this to the team a little better.

Well, that didn't take long.
[#cve202346747](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202346747) has now been
reported by F5 as being exploited in the wild. This can be found in an updated
section of the advisory towards the bottom at
[https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353).

Interestingly enough, the in-the-wild exploitation is using the SQL injection
vulnerability (CVE-2023-46748) in conjunction with the AJP request smuggling
attack to achieve access. This vulnerability was also included in the same KB
advisory as the AJP request smuggling attack.

Originally I wasn't sure if the SQL injection vuln report was the other
security researcher(s) who had also reported the AJP Request Smuggling content
to F5, but given the way this is being exploited in the wild it sure looks
like this is the case.

 **Aqua** reports that Kinsing threat actors are exploiting CVE-2023-4911 (7.8
high severity, disclosed 03 October 2023 by Qualsys) dubbed "Looney Tunables"
to breach cloud environments. CVE-2017-9841 (9.8 critical, PHPUnit RCE
vulnerability disclosed 19 November 2017) is first leveraged for initial
access. The end goal of the attack appears to be to extract credentials
associated with the cloud service provider for follow-on attacks. Aqua states
that the threat actor has been actively involved in cryptojacking operations.

Im Kontext der aktuellen Citrix Schwachstelle
([https://cert.at/de/aktuelles/2023/10/cve-2023-4966-0day](https://cert.at/de/aktuelles/2023/10/cve-2023-4966-0day))
hab ich einen spannenden Effekt wieder mal beobachtet:

Die Frage vom Management "Sind wir betroffen?" ist nicht immer einfach zu
beantworten. Man müsste Logs durchgraben und eventuell auch noch Forensik
machen, um sicherzustellen, dass es entweder keinen Session-Reconnects durch
Tätergruppen gab und falls doch, es dann keine relevante Aktivität in diesen
Session gab. Schwierig und aufwändig.

Daher wird manchmal unbewusst eine andere Frage beantwortet, nämlich "Haben
wir wir uns an unsere Patch-Policy gehalten?", oder noch einfacher: "Haben wir
was falsch gemacht?". Das ist einfach zu beantworten: "Patch kam am 10. raus,
wir haben den am nächsten Tag eingespielt. Alles gut, man kann uns nichts
vorwerfen."

Es ist aber die Natur von 0-day Schwachstellen, dass es auch diejenigen
treffen kann, die nichts falsch gemacht haben. Ja, das ist unangenehm. Für den
Techniker. Für den CISO. Und im Fall der aktuellen Citrix-Schwachstelle kann
man sich auch kaum vorwerfen lassen, dass das Teil aus dem Internet erreichbar
war.

Daher: bitte macht keine Abkürzungen. Schaut auf eure Logs. Von Mandiant gibt
es Tipps dazu, und von uns ein Script. Siehe
[https://cert.at/de/aktuelles/2023/10/cve-2023-4966-0day](https://cert.at/de/aktuelles/2023/10/cve-2023-4966-0day)

Even if you aren't affected by this vuln this report by
[#mandiant](https://infosec.exchange/tags/mandiant) is well worth the read for
the TTPs in use after the initial exploit.

If you are affected and not patched you really need to read this!

After a short smoke break, folks are at CVE-2023-4966 and CVE-2023-4967 again.

I won't use the cute name or logo for it b/c we need to grow up as an
industry.

I truly hope Pulse Secure is not on the menu this week. Defenders/Responders
are likely exhausted by now.

Mandiant has a new blog out on
[#CitrixBleed](https://cyberplace.social/tags/CitrixBleed) which backs up a
key point from my blog [https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/session-
hijacking-citrix-
cve-2023-4966](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/session-hijacking-
citrix-cve-2023-4966)

The initial exploit string isn’t logged.. at all.

There’s some good hunting stuff in the blog (ICA sessions) - I’d say combine
it with the GetUserName thing in my blog for assurance.

The other big take away is a ton of orgs have been compromised and don’t know
yet. [#threatintel](https://cyberplace.social/tags/threatintel)

Ransomware groups are among the attackers targeting NetScaler ADC and Gateway
Devices to exploit CVE-2023-4966 and bypass multifactor authentication.
NetScaler urges users to "immediately" update their software as well as kill
"all active and persistent sessions," since attackers can grab them from
memory to defeat access controls.

Welcome to my new followers. I have taken possession of your souls, for which
I am _eternally_ grateful.

By way of [#introduction](https://infosec.exchange/tags/introduction), here
are a few things that I am sometimes known for:

  * I wrote the book [API Security in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/api-security-in-action) published by Manning. It covers a lot about modern application security, JWTs, OAuth, Kubernetes, and is secretly a tutorial on cryptography in disguise.

  * I discovered the [“Psychic Signatures”](https://neilmadden.blog/2022/04/19/psychic-signatures-in-java/) critical vulnerability in Java’s implementation of ECDSA signature verification (CVE-2022-21449).

  * My [blog](https://neilmadden.blog) has made its way onto [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=neilmadden.blog) a few times.

  * I’m fairly active in the [#OAuth](https://infosec.exchange/tags/OAuth) working group at the IETF. I used to be the Security Architect for ForgeRock (now part of Ping Identity).

In my past I have mostly been a software engineer. I also have a PhD in
computer science, for what it’s worth, but only my bank calls me Dr and my
daughter thinks I’m lying about that.

These days I run a company, [Illuminated Security](https://illuminated-
security.com), that provides AppSec and Applied Cryptography consultancy,
review, bespoke development, and training. I’m always happy to answer emails
(eventually!) on most topics.

		Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Prior to versions 3.5.14, 4.0.10, 4.1.8, and 4.2.0-rc2, under certain circumstances, attackers can exploit a flaw in domain name normalization to spoof domains they do not own. Versions 3.5.14, 4.0.10, 4.1.8, and 4.2.0-rc2 contain a patch for this issue.

And here we go for the 2nd blog post about a vulnerability in Mastodon. It
details how HTTP signatures can be bypassed because of an innocuous bug, and
how it can lead to the spoofing of Mastodon instances depending on their
domain name. Don't worry, infosec.exchange wasn't vulnerable ;)

After a short smoke break, folks are at CVE-2023-4966 and CVE-2023-4967 again.

I won't use the cute name or logo for it b/c we need to grow up as an
industry.

I truly hope Pulse Secure is not on the menu this week. Defenders/Responders
are likely exhausted by now.

In case you missed it (because I did): On 02 November, **Cisco** updated their
blog post about the actively exploited zero-days CVE-2023-20198 and
CVE-2023-20273, stating that they identified a new version of the implant, now
called BadCandy, and added expected response from the new version of the
implant against one of the HTTP requests used to check for infected device.

Cisco Talos has published a technical analysis of BadCandy, the implant
deployed on Cisco IOS XE routers via the two recent zero-days CVE-2023-20198
and CVE-2023-20273: [https://blog.talosintelligence.com/active-exploitation-
of-cisco-ios-xe-software/](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/active-
exploitation-of-cisco-ios-xe-software/)

Talos says the malware is now at v3, showing that threat actors are still
actively modifying their attacks and malware to maintain access to the
compromised boxes. The latest v3 modifications appear to have worked, as
Shadowserver has stopped detecting infected systems:

In Feb of 2023 this year the Edge team replaced pdfium with a PDF reader from
Adobe. The project was a joint collaboration with Adobe focused quite a bit on
security and took us over a year to get it ready for release.

I was really worried we would get crushed with bugs. Adobe's original PDF
renderer was an old target of mine. It seems however the work we did paid off.
It took 8 months before Edge got their first external report in the PDF
renderer. [https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-

🚨 Last Friday, some seriously horrible Exchange CVEs from ZDI popped up. All
require auth.

We're seeing _alot_ of credential harvester activity like this Joomla one ever
since those CVEs came out.

I fear many Exchange setups w/o MFA are going to have a truly horrible week.

🧰 Microsoft spotted the exploitation of a SysAid zero-day vulnerability in
limited attacks carried out by the Lace Tempest group  
➥ [@securityaffairs](https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs)

「 The Lace Tempest operators exploited the vulnerability to issue commands via
the SysAid software to deliver a loader for the Gracewire malware (aka
FlawedGrace). The malware enabled human-operated activity, including lateral
movement, data theft, and ransomware deployment 」

[@AAKL](https://noc.social/@AAKL) Yep, I tooted about it yesterday morning
while the news was fresh. There's a Microsoft Threat Intelligence
[tweet](https://twitter.com/msftsecintel/status/1722444141081076219). The
official SysAid [security advisory](https://www.sysaid.com/blog/service-
desk/on-premise-software-security-vulnerability-notification) describes post-
compromise activity and includes PowerShell commands and Indicators of
Compromise. The Huntress [article](https://www.huntress.com/blog/critical-
vulnerability-sysaid-cve-2023-47246) contains technical analysis and
additional IOC.

CISA and federal agencies are aware of the exploited Zero-Day, and are likely
to add at least 2-3 to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog soon.

From SysAid’s write up about active attacks attributed to Cl0p.

"\- Checks all running processes for any process beginning with the name
“Sophos” [and only Sophos] and if found, exits.  
\- If no matching processes are found, starts the user.exe malware."

SysAid On-Prem Software customers should read and apply the update discussed
to address CVE-2023-47246 Vulnerability.

Ich habe eine CVE-ID am 4. Nov angefordert. Dennoch erscheint die RC
Schwachstelle nun über CVE-2023-47272, welche später und von jemand anderem
eingereicht wurde. 🤷

Nebenbei bemerkt ist diese Schwachstelle trotz der möglichen Eskalation (siehe
Video) nur mit Medium zu beziffern.

Ist zwar medium aber man könnte damit alle E-Mails eines Accounts abgreifen.

Hier zeigt sich sehr schön, warum CVSS4.0 für die Bestimmung des Base-Scores
so viel besser geeignet ist.

		On Windows, The IsLocal function does not correctly detect reserved device names in some cases. Reserved names followed by spaces, such as "COM1 ", and reserved names "COM" and "LPT" followed by superscript 1, 2, or 3, are incorrectly reported as local. With fix, IsLocal now correctly reports these names as non-local.

		<p class=description>
		The filepath package does not recognize paths with a \??\ prefix as special. On Windows, a path beginning with \??\ is a Root Local Device path equivalent to a path beginning with \\?\. Paths with a \??\ prefix may be used to access arbitrary locations on the system. For example, the path \??\c:\x is equivalent to the more common path c:\x. Before fix, Clean could convert a rooted path such as \a\..\??\b into the root local device path \??\b. Clean will now convert this to .\??\b. Similarly, Join(\, ??, b) could convert a seemingly innocent sequence of path elements into the root local device path \??\b. Join will now convert this to \.\??\b. In addition, with fix, IsAbs now correctly reports paths beginning with \??\ as absolute, and VolumeName correctly reports the \??\ prefix as a volume name.
