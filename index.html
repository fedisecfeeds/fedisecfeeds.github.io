		All versions of Confluence Data Center and Server are affected by this unexploited vulnerability. This Improper Authorization vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to reset Confluence and create a Confluence instance administrator account. Using this account, an attacker can then perform all administrative actions that are available to Confluence instance administrator leading to - but not limited to - full loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability. 

Atlassian Cloud sites are not affected by this vulnerability. If your Confluence site is accessed via an atlassian.net domain, it is hosted by Atlassian and is not vulnerable to this issue.

To help mitigate the [#atlassian](https://infosec.exchange/tags/atlassian)
[#confluence](https://infosec.exchange/tags/confluence)
[#ransomware](https://infosec.exchange/tags/ransomware) as a result of
[#cve202322518](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202322518)

1\. Dont run Jira or Confluence as root on the linux box. (Good advice for any
web app).

2\. Install the database on a different machine from the web server. Even if
your web server gets compromised and encrypted the data in Jira will remain
safe and recoverable.

3\. Encrypt the database tables for added protection against data theft.

4\. Keep multiple daily server backups / snapshots so you can recover from a
clean backup.

5\. Monitor outbound traffic for spikes realted to data exfiltration.

6\. Monitor CPU for spikes that might represent encryption activity.

MOST IMPORTANT - DONT RUN Atlassian products on the open Internet!

Atlassian has raised the severity of CVE-2023-22518 from CVSS 9.1 to 🔟, the
highest critical rating, due to a change in the attack's scope. This critical
security advisory concerns CVE-2023-22518, which highlights an improper
authorization vulnerability in Confluence Data Center and Server. The
vulnerability, now rated at a CVSS score of 🔟, the highest critical rating,
enables an unauthenticated attacker to reset Confluence and create an
administrator account, potentially leading to a complete data compromise.
Atlassian has detected active exploitation and strongly recommends immediate
application of the provided fixes. If immediate patching is not possible,
temporary mitigations such as network restrictions and specific configuration
changes can be implemented. It is imperative for customers to thoroughly
review their threat detection systems for any signs of compromise and follow
their security incident response plan if any evidence of a breach is
discovered. 🛡️

Well, that didn't take long.
[#cve202346747](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202346747) has now been
reported by F5 as being exploited in the wild. This can be found in an updated
section of the advisory towards the bottom at
[https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353).

Interestingly enough, the in-the-wild exploitation is using the SQL injection
vulnerability (CVE-2023-46748) in conjunction with the AJP request smuggling
attack to achieve access. This vulnerability was also included in the same KB
advisory as the AJP request smuggling attack.

Originally I wasn't sure if the SQL injection vuln report was the other
security researcher(s) who had also reported the AJP Request Smuggling content
to F5, but given the way this is being exploited in the wild it sure looks
like this is the case.

Since [@pdnuclei](https://bird.makeup/users/pdnuclei) has posted a full PoC
for [#cve202346747](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202346747) already, we've
updated our blog post at [https://www.praetorian.com/blog/refresh-
compromising-f5-big-ip-with-request-smuggling-
cve-2023-46747/](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/refresh-compromising-f5-big-
ip-with-request-smuggling-cve-2023-46747/) with all the technical details.

Kudos to [@rootxharsh](https://bird.makeup/users/rootxharsh) and
[@iamnoooob](https://bird.makeup/users/iamnoooob) for SUCH a quick
reproduction of the bug as well!

A warning for folks who are going to start spraying this around though:

The process of abusing AJP request smuggling causes Tomcat and Apache to get
out of sync. So as you send more of these requests, the de-sync gets worse.
Eventually the server gets so out of sync that it becomes incapable of
actually serving the correct site once you ask for it.

During testing we regularly would get our F5-BIGIP so jammed up that it was
just faster to do a full server reboot than it was to wait for things to clear
out normally. There's a secondary bug here in that if you do this enough,
you'll eventually catch the login session of someone else trying to hit the
server, but given the fact that you can get RCE through this as well, it seems
not to be as huge of a deal.

I do hope folks patched though - if you weren't paying attention on
Thursday/Friday you're gonna get snuck by this one pretty badly. A 72 hour
window isn't a massive amount of time unfortunately.

For what it's worth, at a glance there wasn't anything SUPER insane exposed on
the internet when we did a check. We did find one cisa.gov server, which we
notified them about and it was taken down before the ball started rolling on
this stuff. Lots and lots of telecoms though.

 **CVE-2023-46747** is a critical severity (CVSSv3: **9.8** ) vulnerability in
F5's BIG-IP products that could allow for remote code
execution.[1](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353) It was disclosed
yesterday 26 October 2023 because F5 believed "this vulnerability is now known
outside of F5 and Praetorian thus forcing our hands at an immediate
disclosure."[2](https://infosec.exchange/@bouncyhat/111303026837999061)  
There is currently only a hotfix (no patch) for CVE-2023-46747.  
This should be taken seriously because state actors have previously exploited
critical F5 BIG-IP vulnerabilities: CVE-2020-5902 and CVE-2022-1388 are among
the top 20 actively exploited vulnerabilities by Chinese state-sponsored cyber
actors, as assessed by NSA, CISA and FBI. [3](https://www.cisa.gov/news-
events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-279a). CVE-2020-5902 was identified by
the UK's NCSC as a vulnerability used for initial access by Russia's Foreign
Intelligence Service (SVR)
actors.[4](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory%20Further%20TTPs%20associated%20with%20SVR%20cyber%20actors.pdf)

Well, that didn't take long.
[#cve202346747](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202346747) has now been
reported by F5 as being exploited in the wild. This can be found in an updated
section of the advisory towards the bottom at
[https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353).

Interestingly enough, the in-the-wild exploitation is using the SQL injection
vulnerability (CVE-2023-46748) in conjunction with the AJP request smuggling
attack to achieve access. This vulnerability was also included in the same KB
advisory as the AJP request smuggling attack.

Originally I wasn't sure if the SQL injection vuln report was the other
security researcher(s) who had also reported the AJP Request Smuggling content
to F5, but given the way this is being exploited in the wild it sure looks
like this is the case.

Since [@pdnuclei](https://bird.makeup/users/pdnuclei) has posted a full PoC
for [#cve202346747](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202346747) already, we've
updated our blog post at [https://www.praetorian.com/blog/refresh-
compromising-f5-big-ip-with-request-smuggling-
cve-2023-46747/](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/refresh-compromising-f5-big-
ip-with-request-smuggling-cve-2023-46747/) with all the technical details.

Kudos to [@rootxharsh](https://bird.makeup/users/rootxharsh) and
[@iamnoooob](https://bird.makeup/users/iamnoooob) for SUCH a quick
reproduction of the bug as well!

A warning for folks who are going to start spraying this around though:

The process of abusing AJP request smuggling causes Tomcat and Apache to get
out of sync. So as you send more of these requests, the de-sync gets worse.
Eventually the server gets so out of sync that it becomes incapable of
actually serving the correct site once you ask for it.

During testing we regularly would get our F5-BIGIP so jammed up that it was
just faster to do a full server reboot than it was to wait for things to clear
out normally. There's a secondary bug here in that if you do this enough,
you'll eventually catch the login session of someone else trying to hit the
server, but given the fact that you can get RCE through this as well, it seems
not to be as huge of a deal.

I do hope folks patched though - if you weren't paying attention on
Thursday/Friday you're gonna get snuck by this one pretty badly. A 72 hour
window isn't a massive amount of time unfortunately.

For what it's worth, at a glance there wasn't anything SUPER insane exposed on
the internet when we did a check. We did find one cisa.gov server, which we
notified them about and it was taken down before the ball started rolling on
this stuff. Lots and lots of telecoms though.

Looks like the good folks at Project Discovery have implemented the full F5

suspect we'll be posting the rest of the blog this week.

 **CVE-2023-46747** is a critical severity (CVSSv3: **9.8** ) vulnerability in
F5's BIG-IP products that could allow for remote code
execution.[1](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353) It was disclosed
yesterday 26 October 2023 because F5 believed "this vulnerability is now known
outside of F5 and Praetorian thus forcing our hands at an immediate
disclosure."[2](https://infosec.exchange/@bouncyhat/111303026837999061)  
There is currently only a hotfix (no patch) for CVE-2023-46747.  
This should be taken seriously because state actors have previously exploited
critical F5 BIG-IP vulnerabilities: CVE-2020-5902 and CVE-2022-1388 are among
the top 20 actively exploited vulnerabilities by Chinese state-sponsored cyber
actors, as assessed by NSA, CISA and FBI. [3](https://www.cisa.gov/news-
events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-279a). CVE-2020-5902 was identified by
the UK's NCSC as a vulnerability used for initial access by Russia's Foreign
Intelligence Service (SVR)
actors.[4](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory%20Further%20TTPs%20associated%20with%20SVR%20cyber%20actors.pdf)

Looks like the good folks at Project Discovery have implemented the full F5
RCE attack chain in a Nuclei Template already. That didn't take long at all, I
suspect we'll be posting the rest of the blog this week.

 **CVE-2023-46747** is a critical severity (CVSSv3: **9.8** ) vulnerability in
F5's BIG-IP products that could allow for remote code
execution.[1](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353) It was disclosed
yesterday 26 October 2023 because F5 believed "this vulnerability is now known
outside of F5 and Praetorian thus forcing our hands at an immediate
disclosure."[2](https://infosec.exchange/@bouncyhat/111303026837999061)  
There is currently only a hotfix (no patch) for CVE-2023-46747.  
This should be taken seriously because state actors have previously exploited
critical F5 BIG-IP vulnerabilities: CVE-2020-5902 and CVE-2022-1388 are among
the top 20 actively exploited vulnerabilities by Chinese state-sponsored cyber
actors, as assessed by NSA, CISA and FBI. [3](https://www.cisa.gov/news-
events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-279a). CVE-2020-5902 was identified by
the UK's NCSC as a vulnerability used for initial access by Russia's Foreign
Intelligence Service (SVR)
actors.[4](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory%20Further%20TTPs%20associated%20with%20SVR%20cyber%20actors.pdf)

Well, that didn't take long.
[#cve202346747](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202346747) has now been
reported by F5 as being exploited in the wild. This can be found in an updated
section of the advisory towards the bottom at
[https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353).

Interestingly enough, the in-the-wild exploitation is using the SQL injection
vulnerability (CVE-2023-46748) in conjunction with the AJP request smuggling
attack to achieve access. This vulnerability was also included in the same KB
advisory as the AJP request smuggling attack.

Originally I wasn't sure if the SQL injection vuln report was the other
security researcher(s) who had also reported the AJP Request Smuggling content
to F5, but given the way this is being exploited in the wild it sure looks
like this is the case.

Since [@pdnuclei](https://bird.makeup/users/pdnuclei) has posted a full PoC
for [#cve202346747](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202346747) already, we've
updated our blog post at [https://www.praetorian.com/blog/refresh-
compromising-f5-big-ip-with-request-smuggling-
cve-2023-46747/](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/refresh-compromising-f5-big-
ip-with-request-smuggling-cve-2023-46747/) with all the technical details.

Kudos to [@rootxharsh](https://bird.makeup/users/rootxharsh) and
[@iamnoooob](https://bird.makeup/users/iamnoooob) for SUCH a quick
reproduction of the bug as well!

A warning for folks who are going to start spraying this around though:

The process of abusing AJP request smuggling causes Tomcat and Apache to get
out of sync. So as you send more of these requests, the de-sync gets worse.
Eventually the server gets so out of sync that it becomes incapable of
actually serving the correct site once you ask for it.

During testing we regularly would get our F5-BIGIP so jammed up that it was
just faster to do a full server reboot than it was to wait for things to clear
out normally. There's a secondary bug here in that if you do this enough,
you'll eventually catch the login session of someone else trying to hit the
server, but given the fact that you can get RCE through this as well, it seems
not to be as huge of a deal.

I do hope folks patched though - if you weren't paying attention on
Thursday/Friday you're gonna get snuck by this one pretty badly. A 72 hour
window isn't a massive amount of time unfortunately.

For what it's worth, at a glance there wasn't anything SUPER insane exposed on
the internet when we did a check. We did find one cisa.gov server, which we
notified them about and it was taken down before the ball started rolling on
this stuff. Lots and lots of telecoms though.

The web shell, made up of a loader and payload, is passive, allowing requests
to pass through it unnoticed until a request matching a specific parameter is

 **Aon** identified a unique Atlassian Confluence backdoor that persists even
after patching CVE-2023-22515. It grants persistent remote access to every web
page on the server, including the unauthenticated login page, without the need
for a valid user account. The web shell (dubbed "Effluence") is passive,
allowing requests to pass through it unnoticed until a request matching a
specific parameter is provided, at which point it triggers its malicious
behavior by executing a series of actions. No IOC, but detection methods and
YARA Rule provided.

A heavy Confluence news day: **Huntress** can also confirm active exploitation
of Atlassian Confluence Data Center and Confluence Server (CVE-2023-22518)
starting on November 3. Huntress was able to identify exploitation shortly
after patch release due to adversary reliance on common post-exploitation
behaviors. IOC and PowerShell commands.

🚪 Alert: 'Effluence' Backdoor Persists Despite Patching Atlassian Confluence
Servers  
➥ [@thehackernews](https://infosec.exchange/@thehackernews)

The web shell, made up of a loader and payload, is passive, allowing requests
to pass through it unnoticed until a request matching a specific parameter is
provided, at which point it triggers its malicious behavior by executing a
series of actions.

 **Aon** identified a unique Atlassian Confluence backdoor that persists even
after patching CVE-2023-22515. It grants persistent remote access to every web
page on the server, including the unauthenticated login page, without the need
for a valid user account. The web shell (dubbed "Effluence") is passive,
allowing requests to pass through it unnoticed until a request matching a
specific parameter is provided, at which point it triggers its malicious
behavior by executing a series of actions. No IOC, but detection methods and
YARA Rule provided.

Unit 42 published a threat brief on "Citrix Bleed," after their Incident
Response and Managed Threat Hunting teams have observed ransomware groups
exploiting CVE-2023-4966 (NVD 7.5 high/vendor 9.4 critical, disclosed 10
October 2023 by Citrix, reported exploited in the wild as a zero day by
Mandiant on 17 October, added to CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog

 **Mandiant** provided an updated blog regarding Citrix Netscaler ADC and
Gateway CVE-2023-4966 (9.4 high severity, disclosed 10 October 2023 by Citrix)
exploitation. Mandiant then found evidence of zero-day exploitation in the
wild beginning in late August 2023. Mandiant discusses artifacts that can be
used to identify exploitation activity and highlights some of the post
exploitation techniques observed during the incident response investigations.

[@simontsui](https://infosec.exchange/@simontsui) Good question. It's not that
simple :)

I agree with all of your observations. Personally, I like
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) the best for
readability.

The cvecrowd crawler searches for
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966),
[#CVE2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE2023_4966),
[#CVE_20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_20234966),
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) just to not miss
anything. However, the thing that makes it complicated is searching for the
hashtags used. There are too many CVE numbers to search for all of them
regularly.

When searching for [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE) results do not
include ANY of the above formats. Ironically, what it does find is
[#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966.

In addition to hashtags, I also use full text search. When searching for "CVE"
it finds CVE-2023-4966, but not when its written as a hashtag.

So a reliable way to get my crawler to find CVE posts is to use either the
word "CVE", perhaps in combination with a CVE ID as described above, or the
hashtag [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE).

[@kpwn](https://infosec.exchange/@kpwn) do you have a preference for how the
hashtags should be written? Prior to Mastodon toots being searchable (and a
lot of people still haven't allowed for public searching of their toots), the
only way to link the vulnerabilities was to hashtag them. I realized within
the first try that [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966 breaks
and would have be typed as

" **Urgent Patch Alert: Citrix NetScaler CVE-2023-4966** "

Citrix has issued an urgent warning for admins to patch the NetScaler
CVE-2023-4966 vulnerability immediately. This critical flaw, rated 9.4/10 in
severity, allows remote exploitation without user interaction. The
vulnerability affects NetScaler appliances configured as a Gateway or an AAA
virtual server. Although Citrix initially had no evidence of exploitation in
the wild, Mandiant disclosed ongoing attacks a week later. Threat actors have
been leveraging this zero-day since late August 2023 to hijack authentication
sessions, potentially bypassing multifactor authentication. Mandiant also
reported instances where the vulnerability was used to infiltrate government
and tech corporation infrastructures. Admins are strongly advised to patch and
kill all active sessions.

 **Mandiant** provided an updated blog regarding Citrix Netscaler ADC and
Gateway CVE-2023-4966 (9.4 high severity, disclosed 10 October 2023 by Citrix)
exploitation. Mandiant then found evidence of zero-day exploitation in the
wild beginning in late August 2023. Mandiant discusses artifacts that can be
used to identify exploitation activity and highlights some of the post
exploitation techniques observed during the incident response investigations.

[@simontsui](https://infosec.exchange/@simontsui) Good question. It's not that
simple :)

I agree with all of your observations. Personally, I like
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) the best for
readability.

The cvecrowd crawler searches for
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966),
[#CVE2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE2023_4966),
[#CVE_20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_20234966),
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) just to not miss
anything. However, the thing that makes it complicated is searching for the
hashtags used. There are too many CVE numbers to search for all of them
regularly.

When searching for [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE) results do not
include ANY of the above formats. Ironically, what it does find is
[#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966.

In addition to hashtags, I also use full text search. When searching for "CVE"
it finds CVE-2023-4966, but not when its written as a hashtag.

So a reliable way to get my crawler to find CVE posts is to use either the
word "CVE", perhaps in combination with a CVE ID as described above, or the
hashtag [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE).

[@kpwn](https://infosec.exchange/@kpwn) do you have a preference for how the
hashtags should be written? Prior to Mastodon toots being searchable (and a
lot of people still haven't allowed for public searching of their toots), the
only way to link the vulnerabilities was to hashtag them. I realized within
the first try that [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966 breaks
and would have be typed as
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966) ... and I even see
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966). While less
commonly used, I admit that it's easier to read than
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966).

 **Mandiant** provided an updated blog regarding Citrix Netscaler ADC and
Gateway CVE-2023-4966 (9.4 high severity, disclosed 10 October 2023 by Citrix)
exploitation. Mandiant then found evidence of zero-day exploitation in the
wild beginning in late August 2023. Mandiant discusses artifacts that can be
used to identify exploitation activity and highlights some of the post
exploitation techniques observed during the incident response investigations.

[@kpwn](https://infosec.exchange/@kpwn) do you have a preference for how the
hashtags should be written? Prior to Mastodon toots being searchable (and a
lot of people still haven't allowed for public searching of their toots), the
only way to link the vulnerabilities was to hashtag them. I realized within
the first try that [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966 breaks
and would have be typed as
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966) ... and I even see
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966). While less
commonly used, I admit that it's easier to read than
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966).

" **Urgent Patch Alert: Citrix NetScaler CVE-2023-4966** "

Citrix has issued an urgent warning for admins to patch the NetScaler
CVE-2023-4966 vulnerability immediately. This critical flaw, rated 9.4/10 in
severity, allows remote exploitation without user interaction. The
vulnerability affects NetScaler appliances configured as a Gateway or an AAA
virtual server. Although Citrix initially had no evidence of exploitation in
the wild, Mandiant disclosed ongoing attacks a week later. Threat actors have
been leveraging this zero-day since late August 2023 to hijack authentication
sessions, potentially bypassing multifactor authentication. Mandiant also
reported instances where the vulnerability was used to infiltrate government
and tech corporation infrastructures. Admins are strongly advised to patch and
kill all active sessions.

" **Urgent Patch Alert: Citrix NetScaler CVE-2023-4966** "

Citrix has issued an urgent warning for admins to patch the NetScaler
CVE-2023-4966 vulnerability immediately. This critical flaw, rated 9.4/10 in
severity, allows remote exploitation without user interaction. The
vulnerability affects NetScaler appliances configured as a Gateway or an AAA
virtual server. Although Citrix initially had no evidence of exploitation in
the wild, Mandiant disclosed ongoing attacks a week later. Threat actors have
been leveraging this zero-day since late August 2023 to hijack authentication
sessions, potentially bypassing multifactor authentication. Mandiant also
reported instances where the vulnerability was used to infiltrate government
and tech corporation infrastructures. Admins are strongly advised to patch and
kill all active sessions.

[@simontsui](https://infosec.exchange/@simontsui) Good question. It's not that
simple :)

I agree with all of your observations. Personally, I like
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) the best for
readability.

The cvecrowd crawler searches for
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966),
[#CVE2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE2023_4966),
[#CVE_20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_20234966),
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) just to not miss
anything. However, the thing that makes it complicated is searching for the
hashtags used. There are too many CVE numbers to search for all of them
regularly.

When searching for [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE) results do not
include ANY of the above formats. Ironically, what it does find is
[#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966.

In addition to hashtags, I also use full text search. When searching for "CVE"
it finds CVE-2023-4966, but not when its written as a hashtag.

So a reliable way to get my crawler to find CVE posts is to use either the
word "CVE", perhaps in combination with a CVE ID as described above, or the
hashtag [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE).

[@kpwn](https://infosec.exchange/@kpwn) do you have a preference for how the
hashtags should be written? Prior to Mastodon toots being searchable (and a
lot of people still haven't allowed for public searching of their toots), the
only way to link the vulnerabilities was to hashtag them. I realized within
the first try that [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966 breaks
and would have be typed as
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966) ... and I even see
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966). While less
commonly used, I admit that it's easier to read than
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966).

Semi-occasional mention of a decade-old and long-unresolved HP and HPE iLO

This IPMI vulnerability effects most HP and HPE Integrity Itanium servers
running OpenVMS, or whatever other operating system happens to be running
“upstairs” from the iLO, so long as IPMI is enabled and accessible.

Yes, various of these servers are still in use.

Semi-occasional mention of a decade-old and long-unresolved HP and HPE iLO
vulnerability to brute-forcing of a network-accessible management processor
password:

CVE-2013-4786

[https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=emr_na-c04197764](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=emr_na-c04197764)

This IPMI vulnerability effects most HP and HPE Integrity Itanium servers
running OpenVMS, or whatever other operating system happens to be running
“upstairs” from the iLO, so long as IPMI is enabled and accessible.

Yes, various of these servers are still in use.

To disable IPMI on most iLO management processors:

🧰 Microsoft spotted the exploitation of a SysAid zero-day vulnerability in
limited attacks carried out by the Lace Tempest group  
➥ [@securityaffairs](https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs)

「 The Lace Tempest operators exploited the vulnerability to issue commands via
the SysAid software to deliver a loader for the Gracewire malware (aka
FlawedGrace). The malware enabled human-operated activity, including lateral

[@AAKL](https://noc.social/@AAKL) Yep, I tooted about it yesterday morning
while the news was fresh. There's a Microsoft Threat Intelligence
[tweet](https://twitter.com/msftsecintel/status/1722444141081076219). The
official SysAid [security advisory](https://www.sysaid.com/blog/service-
desk/on-premise-software-security-vulnerability-notification) describes post-
compromise activity and includes PowerShell commands and Indicators of
Compromise. The Huntress [article](https://www.huntress.com/blog/critical-
vulnerability-sysaid-cve-2023-47246) contains technical analysis and
additional IOC.

CISA and federal agencies are aware of the exploited Zero-Day, and are likely
to add at least 2-3 to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog soon.
