		Cisco is aware of active exploitation of a previously unknown vulnerability in the web UI feature of Cisco IOS XE Software when exposed to the internet or to untrusted networks. This vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to create an account on an affected system with privilege level 15 access. The attacker can then use that account to gain control of the affected system.
 For steps to close the attack vector for this vulnerability, see the Recommendations section of this advisoryÂ 
 Cisco will provide updates on the status of this investigation and when a software patch is available.

In case you missed it (because I did): On 02 November, **Cisco** updated their
blog post about the actively exploited zero-days CVE-2023-20198 and
CVE-2023-20273, stating that they identified a new version of the implant, now
called BadCandy, and added expected response from the new version of the
implant against one of the HTTP requests used to check for infected device.

 **Horizon3** provides "exploit theory crafting" after patch diffing Cisco's
IOS XE zero-day 17.9.4a patch (CVE-2023-20198, CVE-2023-20273):

  1. A new custom header, âProxy-Uri-Sourceâ, is set in the Nginx configs and checked in the `iosd` binary before allowing access to the wsma endpoints
    1. The attacker has discovered a method to pass requests to the `wsma` endpoints without control of the forwarded headers
    2. The `wsma` endpoints expects an XML payload and will execute any arbitrary IOS CLI command in it
  2. Updates to IPv6 address validation which is utilized in builtin software install functionality in endpoints like `/webui/rest/upgrade` or via `wsma`
    1. The attacker has discovered a way to write and execute arbitrary files by abusing this validation failure
    2. The software install vector also corresponds with the observed IOC in the Talos blog `%WEBUI-6-INSTALL_OPERATION_INFO: User: username, Install Operation: ADD filename`

Regarding the [#Cisco](https://infosec.exchange/tags/Cisco)
[#IOS](https://infosec.exchange/tags/IOS) XE web UI RCE vuln, I wanted to test
a few things in a lab environment to help with forensics, detection, etc. But
the software is [#proprietary](https://infosec.exchange/tags/proprietary) and
it seems Cisco tries quite hard to make it inaccessible to anyone not paying
them. So it's a challenge for

 **Horizon3** provides "exploit theory crafting" after patch diffing Cisco's
IOS XE zero-day 17.9.4a patch (CVE-2023-20198, CVE-2023-20273):

  1. A new custom header, âProxy-Uri-Sourceâ, is set in the Nginx configs and checked in the `iosd` binary before allowing access to the wsma endpoints
    1. The attacker has discovered a method to pass requests to the `wsma` endpoints without control of the forwarded headers
    2. The `wsma` endpoints expects an XML payload and will execute any arbitrary IOS CLI command in it
  2. Updates to IPv6 address validation which is utilized in builtin software install functionality in endpoints like `/webui/rest/upgrade` or via `wsma`
    1. The attacker has discovered a way to write and execute arbitrary files by abusing this validation failure
    2. The software install vector also corresponds with the observed IOC in the Talos blog `%WEBUI-6-INSTALL_OPERATION_INFO: User: username, Install Operation: ADD filename`

Regarding the [#Cisco](https://infosec.exchange/tags/Cisco)
[#IOS](https://infosec.exchange/tags/IOS) XE web UI RCE vuln, I wanted to test
a few things in a lab environment to help with forensics, detection, etc. But
the software is [#proprietary](https://infosec.exchange/tags/proprietary) and
it seems Cisco tries quite hard to make it inaccessible to anyone not paying
them. So it's a challenge for
[#defenders](https://infosec.exchange/tags/defenders) to get some basic
answers from a device they control and know is not compromised.

 **Horizon3** provides "exploit theory crafting" after patch diffing Cisco's
IOS XE zero-day 17.9.4a patch (CVE-2023-20198, CVE-2023-20273):

  1. A new custom header, âProxy-Uri-Sourceâ, is set in the Nginx configs and checked in the `iosd` binary before allowing access to the wsma endpoints
    1. The attacker has discovered a method to pass requests to the `wsma` endpoints without control of the forwarded headers
    2. The `wsma` endpoints expects an XML payload and will execute any arbitrary IOS CLI command in it
  2. Updates to IPv6 address validation which is utilized in builtin software install functionality in endpoints like `/webui/rest/upgrade` or via `wsma`
    1. The attacker has discovered a way to write and execute arbitrary files by abusing this validation failure
    2. The software install vector also corresponds with the observed IOC in the Talos blog `%WEBUI-6-INSTALL_OPERATION_INFO: User: username, Install Operation: ADD filename`

Regarding the [#Cisco](https://infosec.exchange/tags/Cisco)
[#IOS](https://infosec.exchange/tags/IOS) XE web UI RCE vuln, I wanted to test
a few things in a lab environment to help with forensics, detection, etc. But
the software is [#proprietary](https://infosec.exchange/tags/proprietary) and
it seems Cisco tries quite hard to make it inaccessible to anyone not paying
them. So it's a challenge for
[#defenders](https://infosec.exchange/tags/defenders) to get some basic
answers from a device they control and know is not compromised.

In case you missed it (because I did): On 02 November, **Cisco** updated their
blog post about the actively exploited zero-days CVE-2023-20198 and
CVE-2023-20273, stating that they identified a new version of the implant, now
called BadCandy, and added expected response from the new version of the
implant against one of the HTTP requests used to check for infected device.

 **Horizon3** provides "exploit theory crafting" after patch diffing Cisco's
IOS XE zero-day 17.9.4a patch (CVE-2023-20198, CVE-2023-20273):

  1. A new custom header, âProxy-Uri-Sourceâ, is set in the Nginx configs and checked in the `iosd` binary before allowing access to the wsma endpoints
    1. The attacker has discovered a method to pass requests to the `wsma` endpoints without control of the forwarded headers
    2. The `wsma` endpoints expects an XML payload and will execute any arbitrary IOS CLI command in it
  2. Updates to IPv6 address validation which is utilized in builtin software install functionality in endpoints like `/webui/rest/upgrade` or via `wsma`
    1. The attacker has discovered a way to write and execute arbitrary files by abusing this validation failure
    2. The software install vector also corresponds with the observed IOC in the Talos blog `%WEBUI-6-INSTALL_OPERATION_INFO: User: username, Install Operation: ADD filename`

Regarding the [#Cisco](https://infosec.exchange/tags/Cisco)
[#IOS](https://infosec.exchange/tags/IOS) XE web UI RCE vuln, I wanted to test
a few things in a lab environment to help with forensics, detection, etc. But
the software is [#proprietary](https://infosec.exchange/tags/proprietary) and
it seems Cisco tries quite hard to make it inaccessible to anyone not paying
them. So it's a challenge for
[#defenders](https://infosec.exchange/tags/defenders) to get some basic
answers from a device they control and know is not compromised.

Well, that didn't take long.
[#cve202346747](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202346747) has now been
reported by F5 as being exploited in the wild. This can be found in an updated
section of the advisory towards the bottom at
[https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353).

Interestingly enough, the in-the-wild exploitation is using the SQL injection
vulnerability (CVE-2023-46748) in conjunction with the AJP request smuggling
attack to achieve access. This vulnerability was also included in the same KB
advisory as the AJP request smuggling attack.

Originally I wasn't sure if the SQL injection vuln report was the other
security researcher(s) who had also reported the AJP Request Smuggling content
to F5, but given the way this is being exploited in the wild it sure looks
like this is the case.

Since [@pdnuclei](https://bird.makeup/users/pdnuclei) has posted a full PoC
for [#cve202346747](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202346747) already, we've
updated our blog post at [https://www.praetorian.com/blog/refresh-
compromising-f5-big-ip-with-request-smuggling-
cve-2023-46747/](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/refresh-compromising-f5-big-
ip-with-request-smuggling-cve-2023-46747/) with all the technical details.

Kudos to [@rootxharsh](https://bird.makeup/users/rootxharsh) and
[@iamnoooob](https://bird.makeup/users/iamnoooob) for SUCH a quick
reproduction of the bug as well!

A warning for folks who are going to start spraying this around though:

The process of abusing AJP request smuggling causes Tomcat and Apache to get
out of sync. So as you send more of these requests, the de-sync gets worse.
Eventually the server gets so out of sync that it becomes incapable of
actually serving the correct site once you ask for it.

During testing we regularly would get our F5-BIGIP so jammed up that it was
just faster to do a full server reboot than it was to wait for things to clear
out normally. There's a secondary bug here in that if you do this enough,
you'll eventually catch the login session of someone else trying to hit the
server, but given the fact that you can get RCE through this as well, it seems
not to be as huge of a deal.

I do hope folks patched though - if you weren't paying attention on
Thursday/Friday you're gonna get snuck by this one pretty badly. A 72 hour
window isn't a massive amount of time unfortunately.

For what it's worth, at a glance there wasn't anything SUPER insane exposed on
the internet when we did a check. We did find one cisa.gov server, which we
notified them about and it was taken down before the ball started rolling on
this stuff. Lots and lots of telecoms though.

Looks like the good folks at Project Discovery have implemented the full F5

suspect we'll be posting the rest of the blog this week.

 **CVE-2023-46747** is a critical severity (CVSSv3: **9.8** ) vulnerability in
F5's BIG-IP products that could allow for remote code
execution.[1](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353) It was disclosed
yesterday 26 October 2023 because F5 believed "this vulnerability is now known
outside of F5 and Praetorian thus forcing our hands at an immediate
disclosure."[2](https://infosec.exchange/@bouncyhat/111303026837999061)  
There is currently only a hotfix (no patch) for CVE-2023-46747.  
This should be taken seriously because state actors have previously exploited
critical F5 BIG-IP vulnerabilities: CVE-2020-5902 and CVE-2022-1388 are among
the top 20 actively exploited vulnerabilities by Chinese state-sponsored cyber
actors, as assessed by NSA, CISA and FBI. [3](https://www.cisa.gov/news-
events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-279a). CVE-2020-5902 was identified by
the UK's NCSC as a vulnerability used for initial access by Russia's Foreign
Intelligence Service (SVR)
actors.[4](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory%20Further%20TTPs%20associated%20with%20SVR%20cyber%20actors.pdf)

[https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353).

Interestingly enough, the in-the-wild exploitation is using the SQL injection
vulnerability (CVE-2023-46748) in conjunction with the AJP request smuggling
attack to achieve access. This vulnerability was also included in the same KB
advisory as the AJP request smuggling attack.

Originally I wasn't sure if the SQL injection vuln report was the other
security researcher(s) who had also reported the AJP Request Smuggling content
to F5, but given the way this is being exploited in the wild it sure looks
like this is the case.

Since [@pdnuclei](https://bird.makeup/users/pdnuclei) has posted a full PoC
for [#cve202346747](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202346747) already, we've
updated our blog post at [https://www.praetorian.com/blog/refresh-
compromising-f5-big-ip-with-request-smuggling-
cve-2023-46747/](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/refresh-compromising-f5-big-
ip-with-request-smuggling-cve-2023-46747/) with all the technical details.

Kudos to [@rootxharsh](https://bird.makeup/users/rootxharsh) and
[@iamnoooob](https://bird.makeup/users/iamnoooob) for SUCH a quick
reproduction of the bug as well!

A warning for folks who are going to start spraying this around though:

The process of abusing AJP request smuggling causes Tomcat and Apache to get
out of sync. So as you send more of these requests, the de-sync gets worse.
Eventually the server gets so out of sync that it becomes incapable of
actually serving the correct site once you ask for it.

During testing we regularly would get our F5-BIGIP so jammed up that it was
just faster to do a full server reboot than it was to wait for things to clear
out normally. There's a secondary bug here in that if you do this enough,
you'll eventually catch the login session of someone else trying to hit the
server, but given the fact that you can get RCE through this as well, it seems
not to be as huge of a deal.

I do hope folks patched though - if you weren't paying attention on
Thursday/Friday you're gonna get snuck by this one pretty badly. A 72 hour
window isn't a massive amount of time unfortunately.

For what it's worth, at a glance there wasn't anything SUPER insane exposed on
the internet when we did a check. We did find one cisa.gov server, which we
notified them about and it was taken down before the ball started rolling on
this stuff. Lots and lots of telecoms though.

Looks like the good folks at Project Discovery have implemented the full F5

suspect we'll be posting the rest of the blog this week.

 **CVE-2023-46747** is a critical severity (CVSSv3: **9.8** ) vulnerability in
F5's BIG-IP products that could allow for remote code
execution.[1](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353) It was disclosed
yesterday 26 October 2023 because F5 believed "this vulnerability is now known
outside of F5 and Praetorian thus forcing our hands at an immediate
disclosure."[2](https://infosec.exchange/@bouncyhat/111303026837999061)  
There is currently only a hotfix (no patch) for CVE-2023-46747.  
This should be taken seriously because state actors have previously exploited
critical F5 BIG-IP vulnerabilities: CVE-2020-5902 and CVE-2022-1388 are among
the top 20 actively exploited vulnerabilities by Chinese state-sponsored cyber
actors, as assessed by NSA, CISA and FBI. [3](https://www.cisa.gov/news-
events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-279a). CVE-2020-5902 was identified by
the UK's NCSC as a vulnerability used for initial access by Russia's Foreign
Intelligence Service (SVR)
actors.[4](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory%20Further%20TTPs%20associated%20with%20SVR%20cyber%20actors.pdf)

Well, that didn't take long.
[#cve202346747](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202346747) has now been
reported by F5 as being exploited in the wild. This can be found in an updated
section of the advisory towards the bottom at
[https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353).

Interestingly enough, the in-the-wild exploitation is using the SQL injection
vulnerability (CVE-2023-46748) in conjunction with the AJP request smuggling
attack to achieve access. This vulnerability was also included in the same KB

Originally I wasn't sure if the SQL injection vuln report was the other

 **CVE-2023-46747** is a critical severity (CVSSv3: **9.8** ) vulnerability in
F5's BIG-IP products that could allow for remote code
execution.[1](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353) It was disclosed
yesterday 26 October 2023 because F5 believed "this vulnerability is now known
outside of F5 and Praetorian thus forcing our hands at an immediate
disclosure."[2](https://infosec.exchange/@bouncyhat/111303026837999061)  
There is currently only a hotfix (no patch) for CVE-2023-46747.  
This should be taken seriously because state actors have previously exploited
critical F5 BIG-IP vulnerabilities: CVE-2020-5902 and CVE-2022-1388 are among
the top 20 actively exploited vulnerabilities by Chinese state-sponsored cyber
actors, as assessed by NSA, CISA and FBI. [3](https://www.cisa.gov/news-
events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-279a). CVE-2020-5902 was identified by
the UK's NCSC as a vulnerability used for initial access by Russia's Foreign
Intelligence Service (SVR)
actors.[4](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory%20Further%20TTPs%20associated%20with%20SVR%20cyber%20actors.pdf)

F5 reports active exploitation of both CVE-2023-46747 and CVE-2023-46748:  
 **Link:**
[https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353)
and
[https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137365](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137365)

We should expect CISA to add both CVE-2023-46747 and CVE-2023-46748 to the
Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog today.

Well, that didn't take long.
[#cve202346747](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202346747) has now been
reported by F5 as being exploited in the wild. This can be found in an updated
section of the advisory towards the bottom at
[https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353).

Interestingly enough, the in-the-wild exploitation is using the SQL injection
vulnerability (CVE-2023-46748) in conjunction with the AJP request smuggling
attack to achieve access. This vulnerability was also included in the same KB
advisory as the AJP request smuggling attack.

Originally I wasn't sure if the SQL injection vuln report was the other
security researcher(s) who had also reported the AJP Request Smuggling content
to F5, but given the way this is being exploited in the wild it sure looks
like this is the case.

Since [@pdnuclei](https://bird.makeup/users/pdnuclei) has posted a full PoC
for [#cve202346747](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202346747) already, we've
updated our blog post at [https://www.praetorian.com/blog/refresh-
compromising-f5-big-ip-with-request-smuggling-
cve-2023-46747/](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/refresh-compromising-f5-big-
ip-with-request-smuggling-cve-2023-46747/) with all the technical details.

Kudos to [@rootxharsh](https://bird.makeup/users/rootxharsh) and
[@iamnoooob](https://bird.makeup/users/iamnoooob) for SUCH a quick
reproduction of the bug as well!

A warning for folks who are going to start spraying this around though:

The process of abusing AJP request smuggling causes Tomcat and Apache to get
out of sync. So as you send more of these requests, the de-sync gets worse.
Eventually the server gets so out of sync that it becomes incapable of
actually serving the correct site once you ask for it.

During testing we regularly would get our F5-BIGIP so jammed up that it was
just faster to do a full server reboot than it was to wait for things to clear
out normally. There's a secondary bug here in that if you do this enough,
you'll eventually catch the login session of someone else trying to hit the
server, but given the fact that you can get RCE through this as well, it seems
not to be as huge of a deal.

I do hope folks patched though - if you weren't paying attention on
Thursday/Friday you're gonna get snuck by this one pretty badly. A 72 hour
window isn't a massive amount of time unfortunately.

For what it's worth, at a glance there wasn't anything SUPER insane exposed on
the internet when we did a check. We did find one cisa.gov server, which we
notified them about and it was taken down before the ball started rolling on
this stuff. Lots and lots of telecoms though.

Looks like the good folks at Project Discovery have implemented the full F5
RCE attack chain in a Nuclei Template already. That didn't take long at all, I
suspect we'll be posting the rest of the blog this week.

 **CVE-2023-46747** is a critical severity (CVSSv3: **9.8** ) vulnerability in
F5's BIG-IP products that could allow for remote code
execution.[1](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353) It was disclosed
yesterday 26 October 2023 because F5 believed "this vulnerability is now known
outside of F5 and Praetorian thus forcing our hands at an immediate
disclosure."[2](https://infosec.exchange/@bouncyhat/111303026837999061)  
There is currently only a hotfix (no patch) for CVE-2023-46747.  
This should be taken seriously because state actors have previously exploited
critical F5 BIG-IP vulnerabilities: CVE-2020-5902 and CVE-2022-1388 are among
the top 20 actively exploited vulnerabilities by Chinese state-sponsored cyber
actors, as assessed by NSA, CISA and FBI. [3](https://www.cisa.gov/news-
events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-279a). CVE-2020-5902 was identified by
the UK's NCSC as a vulnerability used for initial access by Russia's Foreign
Intelligence Service (SVR)
actors.[4](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory%20Further%20TTPs%20associated%20with%20SVR%20cyber%20actors.pdf)

 **Aqua** reports that Kinsing threat actors are exploiting CVE-2023-4911 (7.8
high severity, disclosed 03 October 2023 by Qualsys) dubbed "Looney Tunables"
to breach cloud environments. CVE-2017-9841 (9.8 critical, PHPUnit RCE
vulnerability disclosed 19 November 2017) is first leveraged for initial
access. The end goal of the attack appears to be to extract credentials
associated with the cloud service provider for follow-on attacks. Aqua states
that the threat actor has been actively involved in cryptojacking operations.

 **Aqua** reports that Kinsing threat actors are exploiting CVE-2023-4911 (7.8
high severity, disclosed 03 October 2023 by Qualsys) dubbed "Looney Tunables"
to breach cloud environments. CVE-2017-9841 (9.8 critical, PHPUnit RCE
vulnerability disclosed 19 November 2017) is first leveraged for initial
access. The end goal of the attack appears to be to extract credentials
associated with the cloud service provider for follow-on attacks. Aqua states
that the threat actor has been actively involved in cryptojacking operations.

 **Mandiant** provided an updated blog regarding Citrix Netscaler ADC and
Gateway CVE-2023-4966 (9.4 high severity, disclosed 10 October 2023 by Citrix)
exploitation. Mandiant then found evidence of zero-day exploitation in the
wild beginning in late August 2023. Mandiant discusses artifacts that can be
used to identify exploitation activity and highlights some of the post
exploitation techniques observed during the incident response investigations.

[@simontsui](https://infosec.exchange/@simontsui) Good question. It's not that
simple :)

I agree with all of your observations. Personally, I like
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) the best for
readability.

The cvecrowd crawler searches for
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966),
[#CVE2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE2023_4966),
[#CVE_20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_20234966),
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) just to not miss
anything. However, the thing that makes it complicated is searching for the
hashtags used. There are too many CVE numbers to search for all of them
regularly.

When searching for [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE) results do not
include ANY of the above formats. Ironically, what it does find is
[#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966.

In addition to hashtags, I also use full text search. When searching for "CVE"
it finds CVE-2023-4966, but not when its written as a hashtag.

So a reliable way to get my crawler to find CVE posts is to use either the
word "CVE", perhaps in combination with a CVE ID as described above, or the
hashtag [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE).

[@kpwn](https://infosec.exchange/@kpwn) do you have a preference for how the
hashtags should be written? Prior to Mastodon toots being searchable (and a
lot of people still haven't allowed for public searching of their toots), the
only way to link the vulnerabilities was to hashtag them. I realized within
the first try that [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966 breaks
and would have be typed as
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966) ... and I even see
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966). While less
commonly used, I admit that it's easier to read than
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966).

" **Urgent Patch Alert: Citrix NetScaler CVE-2023-4966** "

Citrix has issued an urgent warning for admins to patch the NetScaler
CVE-2023-4966 vulnerability immediately. This critical flaw, rated 9.4/10 in
severity, allows remote exploitation without user interaction. The
vulnerability affects NetScaler appliances configured as a Gateway or an AAA
virtual server. Although Citrix initially had no evidence of exploitation in
the wild, Mandiant disclosed ongoing attacks a week later. Threat actors have
been leveraging this zero-day since late August 2023 to hijack authentication
sessions, potentially bypassing multifactor authentication. Mandiant also
reported instances where the vulnerability was used to infiltrate government
and tech corporation infrastructures. Admins are strongly advised to patch and
kill all active sessions.

I agree with all of your observations. Personally, I like
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) the best for
readability.

The cvecrowd crawler searches for
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966),
[#CVE2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE2023_4966),
[#CVE_20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_20234966),
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) just to not miss
anything. However, the thing that makes it complicated is searching for the
hashtags used. There are too many CVE numbers to search for all of them
regularly.

When searching for [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE) results do not
include ANY of the above formats. Ironically, what it does find is
[#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966.

In addition to hashtags, I also use full text search. When searching for "CVE"
it finds CVE-2023-4966, but not when its written as a hashtag.

So a reliable way to get my crawler to find CVE posts is to use either the
word "CVE", perhaps in combination with a CVE ID as described above, or the
hashtag [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE).

" **Urgent Patch Alert: Citrix NetScaler CVE-2023-4966** "

Citrix has issued an urgent warning for admins to patch the NetScaler
CVE-2023-4966 vulnerability immediately. This critical flaw, rated 9.4/10 in
severity, allows remote exploitation without user interaction. The
vulnerability affects NetScaler appliances configured as a Gateway or an AAA
virtual server. Although Citrix initially had no evidence of exploitation in
the wild, Mandiant disclosed ongoing attacks a week later. Threat actors have
been leveraging this zero-day since late August 2023 to hijack authentication
sessions, potentially bypassing multifactor authentication. Mandiant also
reported instances where the vulnerability was used to infiltrate government
and tech corporation infrastructures. Admins are strongly advised to patch and
kill all active sessions.

[@simontsui](https://infosec.exchange/@simontsui) Good question. It's not that
simple :)

I agree with all of your observations. Personally, I like
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) the best for
readability.

The cvecrowd crawler searches for
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966),
[#CVE2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE2023_4966),
[#CVE_20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_20234966),
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) just to not miss
anything. However, the thing that makes it complicated is searching for the
hashtags used. There are too many CVE numbers to search for all of them
regularly.

When searching for [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE) results do not
include ANY of the above formats. Ironically, what it does find is
[#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966.

In addition to hashtags, I also use full text search. When searching for "CVE"
it finds CVE-2023-4966, but not when its written as a hashtag.

So a reliable way to get my crawler to find CVE posts is to use either the
word "CVE", perhaps in combination with a CVE ID as described above, or the
hashtag [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE).

 **Mandiant** provided an updated blog regarding Citrix Netscaler ADC and
Gateway CVE-2023-4966 (9.4 high severity, disclosed 10 October 2023 by Citrix)
exploitation. Mandiant then found evidence of zero-day exploitation in the
wild beginning in late August 2023. Mandiant discusses artifacts that can be
used to identify exploitation activity and highlights some of the post
exploitation techniques observed during the incident response investigations.

" **Urgent Patch Alert: Citrix NetScaler CVE-2023-4966** "

Citrix has issued an urgent warning for admins to patch the NetScaler
CVE-2023-4966 vulnerability immediately. This critical flaw, rated 9.4/10 in
severity, allows remote exploitation without user interaction. The
vulnerability affects NetScaler appliances configured as a Gateway or an AAA
virtual server. Although Citrix initially had no evidence of exploitation in
the wild, Mandiant disclosed ongoing attacks a week later. Threat actors have
been leveraging this zero-day since late August 2023 to hijack authentication
sessions, potentially bypassing multifactor authentication. Mandiant also
reported instances where the vulnerability was used to infiltrate government
and tech corporation infrastructures. Admins are strongly advised to patch and
kill all active sessions.

 **Mandiant** provided an updated blog regarding Citrix Netscaler ADC and
Gateway CVE-2023-4966 (9.4 high severity, disclosed 10 October 2023 by Citrix)
exploitation. Mandiant then found evidence of zero-day exploitation in the
wild beginning in late August 2023. Mandiant discusses artifacts that can be
used to identify exploitation activity and highlights some of the post
exploitation techniques observed during the incident response investigations.

[@simontsui](https://infosec.exchange/@simontsui) Good question. It's not that
simple :)

I agree with all of your observations. Personally, I like
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) the best for
readability.

The cvecrowd crawler searches for
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966),
[#CVE2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE2023_4966),
[#CVE_20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_20234966),
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) just to not miss
anything. However, the thing that makes it complicated is searching for the
hashtags used. There are too many CVE numbers to search for all of them
regularly.

When searching for [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE) results do not
include ANY of the above formats. Ironically, what it does find is
[#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966.

In addition to hashtags, I also use full text search. When searching for "CVE"
it finds CVE-2023-4966, but not when its written as a hashtag.

So a reliable way to get my crawler to find CVE posts is to use either the
word "CVE", perhaps in combination with a CVE ID as described above, or the
hashtag [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE).

[@kpwn](https://infosec.exchange/@kpwn) do you have a preference for how the
hashtags should be written? Prior to Mastodon toots being searchable (and a
lot of people still haven't allowed for public searching of their toots), the
only way to link the vulnerabilities was to hashtag them. I realized within
the first try that [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966 breaks
and would have be typed as
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966) ... and I even see
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966). While less
commonly used, I admit that it's easier to read than
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966).

[@simontsui](https://infosec.exchange/@simontsui) Good question. It's not that
simple :)

I agree with all of your observations. Personally, I like
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) the best for
readability.

The cvecrowd crawler searches for
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966),
[#CVE2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE2023_4966),
[#CVE_20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_20234966),
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) just to not miss
anything. However, the thing that makes it complicated is searching for the
hashtags used. There are too many CVE numbers to search for all of them
regularly.

When searching for [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE) results do not
include ANY of the above formats. Ironically, what it does find is
[#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966.

In addition to hashtags, I also use full text search. When searching for "CVE"
it finds CVE-2023-4966, but not when its written as a hashtag.

So a reliable way to get my crawler to find CVE posts is to use either the
word "CVE", perhaps in combination with a CVE ID as described above, or the
hashtag [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE).

[@kpwn](https://infosec.exchange/@kpwn) do you have a preference for how the
hashtags should be written? Prior to Mastodon toots being searchable (and a
lot of people still haven't allowed for public searching of their toots), the
only way to link the vulnerabilities was to hashtag them. I realized within
the first try that [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966 breaks
and would have be typed as
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966) ... and I even see
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966). While less
commonly used, I admit that it's easier to read than
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966).

Apparently [#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.town/tags/CVE_2023_4966) is
"undergoing reanalysis." Wonder if it'll be higher or lower... ð

blog post about the actively exploited zero-days CVE-2023-20198 and
CVE-2023-20273, stating that they identified a new version of the implant, now
called BadCandy, and added expected response from the new version of the
implant against one of the HTTP requests used to check for infected device.

 **Horizon3** provides "exploit theory crafting" after patch diffing Cisco's
IOS XE zero-day 17.9.4a patch (CVE-2023-20198, CVE-2023-20273):

  1. A new custom header, âProxy-Uri-Sourceâ, is set in the Nginx configs and checked in the `iosd` binary before allowing access to the wsma endpoints
    1. The attacker has discovered a method to pass requests to the `wsma` endpoints without control of the forwarded headers
    2. The `wsma` endpoints expects an XML payload and will execute any arbitrary IOS CLI command in it
  2. Updates to IPv6 address validation which is utilized in builtin software install functionality in endpoints like `/webui/rest/upgrade` or via `wsma`
    1. The attacker has discovered a way to write and execute arbitrary files by abusing this validation failure
    2. The software install vector also corresponds with the observed IOC in the Talos blog `%WEBUI-6-INSTALL_OPERATION_INFO: User: username, Install Operation: ADD filename`

[@ntkramer](https://infosec.exchange/@ntkramer) I'm concerned about the impact
of CVE-2023-20273 to Rockwell Automation's Stratix 580/5200 managed industrial
Ethernet switches, which they did not mention because their security bulletin
was released prior to Cisco's updated advisory and blog post:

Surprise announcement by **Rockwell Automation** : CVE-2023-20198 (CVSS **10.0
critical** , disclosed 16 October 2023 by Cisco as an actively exploited zero-
day) also affects their Stratix 5800 and 5200 managed industrial Ethernet

before Cisco's update. No update since. Credit to

blog post about the actively exploited zero-days CVE-2023-20198 and
CVE-2023-20273, stating that they identified a new version of the implant, now
called BadCandy, and added expected response from the new version of the
implant against one of the HTTP requests used to check for infected device.

 **Horizon3** provides "exploit theory crafting" after patch diffing Cisco's
IOS XE zero-day 17.9.4a patch (CVE-2023-20198, CVE-2023-20273):

  1. A new custom header, âProxy-Uri-Sourceâ, is set in the Nginx configs and checked in the `iosd` binary before allowing access to the wsma endpoints
    1. The attacker has discovered a method to pass requests to the `wsma` endpoints without control of the forwarded headers
    2. The `wsma` endpoints expects an XML payload and will execute any arbitrary IOS CLI command in it
  2. Updates to IPv6 address validation which is utilized in builtin software install functionality in endpoints like `/webui/rest/upgrade` or via `wsma`
    1. The attacker has discovered a way to write and execute arbitrary files by abusing this validation failure
    2. The software install vector also corresponds with the observed IOC in the Talos blog `%WEBUI-6-INSTALL_OPERATION_INFO: User: username, Install Operation: ADD filename`

"â ï¸ Critical RCE Alert: 3,000 Apache ActiveMQ Servers at Risk! â ï¸"

Over 3,000 Apache ActiveMQ servers are exposed online, vulnerable to a
critical RCE flaw (CVE-2023-46604, CVSS v3: 10.0). Immediate patching is urged
to prevent potential data theft and network compromise. Stay vigilant! ð¡ï¸ð»

Apache ActiveMQ is an open-source message broker for secure communication
between clients and servers, supporting Java and various cross-language
clients and protocols like AMQP, MQTT, OpenWire, and STOMP.

The flaw in question is CVE-2023-46604, a critical severity (CVSS v3 score:
10.0) RCE that allows attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands by
exploiting class types in the OpenWire protocol.

According to Apache's disclosure on October 27, 2023, this vulnerability
affects the following Apache ActiveMQ and Legacy OpenWire Module versions:

  * Versions before 5.18.3 in the 5.18.x series
  * Versions before 5.17.6 in the 5.17.x series
  * Versions before 5.16.7 in the 5.16.x series
  * All versions before 5.15.16

To address this issue, fixes have been released in versions 5.15.16, 5.16.7,
5.17.6, and 5.18.3. It's recommended to upgrade to one of these versions to
enhance your IT security.

clients and protocols like AMQP, MQTT, OpenWire, and STOMP.

The flaw in question is CVE-2023-46604, a critical severity (CVSS v3 score:
10.0) RCE that allows attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands by
exploiting class types in the OpenWire protocol.

According to Apache's disclosure on October 27, 2023, this vulnerability
affects the following Apache ActiveMQ and Legacy OpenWire Module versions:

  * Versions before 5.18.3 in the 5.18.x series
  * Versions before 5.17.6 in the 5.17.x series
  * Versions before 5.16.7 in the 5.16.x series
  * All versions before 5.15.16

To address this issue, fixes have been released in versions 5.15.16, 5.16.7,
5.17.6, and 5.18.3. It's recommended to upgrade to one of these versions to
enhance your IT security.

To help mitigate the [#atlassian](https://infosec.exchange/tags/atlassian)
[#confluence](https://infosec.exchange/tags/confluence)
[#ransomware](https://infosec.exchange/tags/ransomware) as a result of
[#cve202322518](https://infosec.exchange/tags/cve202322518)

1\. Dont run Jira or Confluence as root on the linux box. (Good advice for any
web app).

2\. Install the database on a different machine from the web server. Even if
your web server gets compromised and encrypted the data in Jira will remain
safe and recoverable.

3\. Encrypt the database tables for added protection against data theft.

4\. Keep multiple daily server backups / snapshots so you can recover from a
clean backup.

5\. Monitor outbound traffic for spikes realted to data exfiltration.

6\. Monitor CPU for spikes that might represent encryption activity.

MOST IMPORTANT - DONT RUN Atlassian products on the open Internet!

enables an unauthenticated attacker to reset Confluence and create an
administrator account, potentially leading to a complete data compromise.
Atlassian has detected active exploitation and strongly recommends immediate
application of the provided fixes. If immediate patching is not possible,
temporary mitigations such as network restrictions and specific configuration
changes can be implemented. It is imperative for customers to thoroughly
review their threat detection systems for any signs of compromise and follow
their security incident response plan if any evidence of a breach is
discovered. ð¡ï¸
