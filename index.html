 **AMD** security advisory: CVE-2023-20592 (medium severity, NVD score
pending, software-based fault injection attack) has a designer name
“CacheWarp”. Improper or unexpected behavior of the INVD instruction in some
AMD CPUs may allow an attacker with a malicious hypervisor to affect cache
line write-back behavior of the CPU leading to a potential loss of guest
virtual machine (VM) memory integrity.
