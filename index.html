[@BleepingComputer](https://infosec.exchange/@BleepingComputer) CVE-2023-46604
(CVSS: 10.0 critical severity, disclosed 26 October 2023 by Apache)  
Apache ActiveMQ is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.The vulnerability may
allow a remote attacker with network access to a broker to run arbitrary shell
commands by manipulating serialized class types in the OpenWire protocol to
cause the broker to instantiate any class on the classpath. Users are
recommended to upgrade to version 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, or 5.18.3, which
fixes this issue.

The Netherlands' National Cyber Security Centrum (NCSC) states that Proof of
Concept has been published publicly, and that they received a report from a
trusted partner that the vulnerability has been actively and specifically
exploited.

[@simontsui](https://infosec.exchange/@simontsui) Good question. It's not that
simple :)

I agree with all of your observations. Personally, I like
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) the best for
readability.

The cvecrowd crawler searches for
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966),
[#CVE2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE2023_4966),
[#CVE_20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_20234966),
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) just to not miss
anything. However, the thing that makes it complicated is searching for the
hashtags used. There are too many CVE numbers to search for all of them
regularly.

When searching for [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE) results do not
include ANY of the above formats. Ironically, what it does find is
[#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966.

In addition to hashtags, I also use full text search. When searching for "CVE"
it finds CVE-2023-4966, but not when its written as a hashtag.

So a reliable way to get my crawler to find CVE posts is to use either the
word "CVE", perhaps in combination with a CVE ID as described above, or the
hashtag [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE).

[@kpwn](https://infosec.exchange/@kpwn) do you have a preference for how the
hashtags should be written? Prior to Mastodon toots being searchable (and a
lot of people still haven't allowed for public searching of their toots), the
only way to link the vulnerabilities was to hashtag them. I realized within
the first try that [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966 breaks
and would have be typed as
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966) ... and I even see
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966). While less
commonly used, I admit that it's easier to read than
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966).

" **Urgent Patch Alert: Citrix NetScaler CVE-2023-4966** "

Citrix has issued an urgent warning for admins to patch the NetScaler
CVE-2023-4966 vulnerability immediately. This critical flaw, rated 9.4/10 in
severity, allows remote exploitation without user interaction. The
vulnerability affects NetScaler appliances configured as a Gateway or an AAA
virtual server. Although Citrix initially had no evidence of exploitation in
the wild, Mandiant disclosed ongoing attacks a week later. Threat actors have
been leveraging this zero-day since late August 2023 to hijack authentication
sessions, potentially bypassing multifactor authentication. Mandiant also
reported instances where the vulnerability was used to infiltrate government
and tech corporation infrastructures. Admins are strongly advised to patch and
kill all active sessions.

word "CVE", perhaps in combination with a CVE ID as described above, or the
hashtag [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE).

[@kpwn](https://infosec.exchange/@kpwn) do you have a preference for how the
hashtags should be written? Prior to Mastodon toots being searchable (and a
lot of people still haven't allowed for public searching of their toots), the
only way to link the vulnerabilities was to hashtag them. I realized within
the first try that [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966 breaks
and would have be typed as
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966) ... and I even see
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966). While less
commonly used, I admit that it's easier to read than
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966).

" **Urgent Patch Alert: Citrix NetScaler CVE-2023-4966** "

Citrix has issued an urgent warning for admins to patch the NetScaler
CVE-2023-4966 vulnerability immediately. This critical flaw, rated 9.4/10 in
severity, allows remote exploitation without user interaction. The
vulnerability affects NetScaler appliances configured as a Gateway or an AAA
virtual server. Although Citrix initially had no evidence of exploitation in
the wild, Mandiant disclosed ongoing attacks a week later. Threat actors have
been leveraging this zero-day since late August 2023 to hijack authentication
sessions, potentially bypassing multifactor authentication. Mandiant also
reported instances where the vulnerability was used to infiltrate government
and tech corporation infrastructures. Admins are strongly advised to patch and
kill all active sessions.

[@simontsui](https://infosec.exchange/@simontsui) Good question. It's not that
simple :)

I agree with all of your observations. Personally, I like
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) the best for
readability.

The cvecrowd crawler searches for
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966),
[#CVE2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE2023_4966),
[#CVE_20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_20234966),
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) just to not miss
anything. However, the thing that makes it complicated is searching for the
hashtags used. There are too many CVE numbers to search for all of them
regularly.

When searching for [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE) results do not
include ANY of the above formats. Ironically, what it does find is
[#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966.

In addition to hashtags, I also use full text search. When searching for "CVE"
it finds CVE-2023-4966, but not when its written as a hashtag.

So a reliable way to get my crawler to find CVE posts is to use either the
word "CVE", perhaps in combination with a CVE ID as described above, or the
hashtag [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE).

 **Mandiant** provided an updated blog regarding Citrix Netscaler ADC and
Gateway CVE-2023-4966 (9.4 high severity, disclosed 10 October 2023 by Citrix)
exploitation. Mandiant then found evidence of zero-day exploitation in the
wild beginning in late August 2023. Mandiant discusses artifacts that can be
used to identify exploitation activity and highlights some of the post
exploitation techniques observed during the incident response investigations.

[@simontsui](https://infosec.exchange/@simontsui) Good question. It's not that
simple :)

I agree with all of your observations. Personally, I like
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) the best for
readability.

The cvecrowd crawler searches for
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966),
[#CVE2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE2023_4966),
[#CVE_20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_20234966),
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) just to not miss
anything. However, the thing that makes it complicated is searching for the
hashtags used. There are too many CVE numbers to search for all of them
regularly.

When searching for [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE) results do not
include ANY of the above formats. Ironically, what it does find is
[#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966.

In addition to hashtags, I also use full text search. When searching for "CVE"
it finds CVE-2023-4966, but not when its written as a hashtag.

So a reliable way to get my crawler to find CVE posts is to use either the
word "CVE", perhaps in combination with a CVE ID as described above, or the
hashtag [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE).

[@kpwn](https://infosec.exchange/@kpwn) do you have a preference for how the
hashtags should be written? Prior to Mastodon toots being searchable (and a
lot of people still haven't allowed for public searching of their toots), the
only way to link the vulnerabilities was to hashtag them. I realized within
the first try that [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966 breaks
and would have be typed as
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966) ... and I even see
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966). While less
commonly used, I admit that it's easier to read than

" **Urgent Patch Alert: Citrix NetScaler CVE-2023-4966** "

Citrix has issued an urgent warning for admins to patch the NetScaler
CVE-2023-4966 vulnerability immediately. This critical flaw, rated 9.4/10 in
severity, allows remote exploitation without user interaction. The
vulnerability affects NetScaler appliances configured as a Gateway or an AAA
virtual server. Although Citrix initially had no evidence of exploitation in
the wild, Mandiant disclosed ongoing attacks a week later. Threat actors have
been leveraging this zero-day since late August 2023 to hijack authentication
sessions, potentially bypassing multifactor authentication. Mandiant also
reported instances where the vulnerability was used to infiltrate government
and tech corporation infrastructures. Admins are strongly advised to patch and
kill all active sessions.

[@simontsui](https://infosec.exchange/@simontsui) Good question. It's not that
simple :)

I agree with all of your observations. Personally, I like
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) the best for
readability.

The cvecrowd crawler searches for
[#CVE20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE20234966),
[#CVE2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE2023_4966),
[#CVE_20234966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_20234966),
[#CVE_2023_4966](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE_2023_4966) just to not miss
anything. However, the thing that makes it complicated is searching for the
hashtags used. There are too many CVE numbers to search for all of them
regularly.

When searching for [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE) results do not
include ANY of the above formats. Ironically, what it does find is
[#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE)-2023-4966.

In addition to hashtags, I also use full text search. When searching for "CVE"
it finds CVE-2023-4966, but not when its written as a hashtag.

So a reliable way to get my crawler to find CVE posts is to use either the
word "CVE", perhaps in combination with a CVE ID as described above, or the
hashtag [#CVE](https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE).

 **Aqua** reports that Kinsing threat actors are exploiting CVE-2023-4911 (7.8
high severity, disclosed 03 October 2023 by Qualsys) dubbed "Looney Tunables"
to breach cloud environments. CVE-2017-9841 (9.8 critical, PHPUnit RCE
vulnerability disclosed 19 November 2017) is first leveraged for initial
access. The end goal of the attack appears to be to extract credentials
associated with the cloud service provider for follow-on attacks. Aqua states
that the threat actor has been actively involved in cryptojacking operations.

(dubbed "Looney Tunables" with a CVSS score of 7.8 high severity, disclosed 03
October 2023 by Qualsys). This vulnerability allows attackers to execute local
privilege escalation (LPE) and acquire complete root privileges. Uptycs notes
that "There are a lot of segfault errors" (local account brute force) and a
noisy exploit, which could be used as an indication of CVE-2023-4911

 **Aqua** reports that Kinsing threat actors are exploiting CVE-2023-4911 (7.8
high severity, disclosed 03 October 2023 by Qualsys) dubbed "Looney Tunables"
to breach cloud environments. CVE-2017-9841 (9.8 critical, PHPUnit RCE
vulnerability disclosed 19 November 2017) is first leveraged for initial
access. The end goal of the attack appears to be to extract credentials
associated with the cloud service provider for follow-on attacks. Aqua states
that the threat actor has been actively involved in cryptojacking operations.

 **Horizon3** provides "exploit theory crafting" after patch diffing Cisco's
IOS XE zero-day 17.9.4a patch (CVE-2023-20198, CVE-2023-20273):

  1. A new custom header, ‚ÄúProxy-Uri-Source‚Äù, is set in the Nginx configs and checked in the `iosd` binary before allowing access to the wsma endpoints
    1. The attacker has discovered a method to pass requests to the `wsma` endpoints without control of the forwarded headers
    2. The `wsma` endpoints expects an XML payload and will execute any arbitrary IOS CLI command in it
  2. Updates to IPv6 address validation which is utilized in builtin software install functionality in endpoints like `/webui/rest/upgrade` or via `wsma`
    1. The attacker has discovered a way to write and execute arbitrary files by abusing this validation failure
    2. The software install vector also corresponds with the observed IOC in the Talos blog `%WEBUI-6-INSTALL_OPERATION_INFO: User: username, Install Operation: ADD filename`

Regarding the [#Cisco](https://infosec.exchange/tags/Cisco)
[#IOS](https://infosec.exchange/tags/IOS) XE web UI RCE vuln, I wanted to test
a few things in a lab environment to help with forensics, detection, etc. But
the software is [#proprietary](https://infosec.exchange/tags/proprietary) and
it seems Cisco tries quite hard to make it inaccessible to anyone not paying
them. So it's a challenge for
[#defenders](https://infosec.exchange/tags/defenders) to get some basic
answers from a device they control and know is not compromised.

 **Horizon3** provides "exploit theory crafting" after patch diffing Cisco's
IOS XE zero-day 17.9.4a patch (CVE-2023-20198, CVE-2023-20273):

  1. A new custom header, ‚ÄúProxy-Uri-Source‚Äù, is set in the Nginx configs and checked in the `iosd` binary before allowing access to the wsma endpoints
    1. The attacker has discovered a method to pass requests to the `wsma` endpoints without control of the forwarded headers
    2. The `wsma` endpoints expects an XML payload and will execute any arbitrary IOS CLI command in it
  2. Updates to IPv6 address validation which is utilized in builtin software install functionality in endpoints like `/webui/rest/upgrade` or via `wsma`
    1. The attacker has discovered a way to write and execute arbitrary files by abusing this validation failure
    2. The software install vector also corresponds with the observed IOC in the Talos blog `%WEBUI-6-INSTALL_OPERATION_INFO: User: username, Install Operation: ADD filename`

Regarding the [#Cisco](https://infosec.exchange/tags/Cisco)
[#IOS](https://infosec.exchange/tags/IOS) XE web UI RCE vuln, I wanted to test
a few things in a lab environment to help with forensics, detection, etc. But
the software is [#proprietary](https://infosec.exchange/tags/proprietary) and
it seems Cisco tries quite hard to make it inaccessible to anyone not paying
them. So it's a challenge for
[#defenders](https://infosec.exchange/tags/defenders) to get some basic
answers from a device they control and know is not compromised.

blog post about the actively exploited zero-days CVE-2023-20198 and
CVE-2023-20273, stating that they identified a new version of the implant, now
called BadCandy, and added expected response from the new version of the
implant against one of the HTTP requests used to check for infected device.

 **Horizon3** provides "exploit theory crafting" after patch diffing Cisco's
IOS XE zero-day 17.9.4a patch (CVE-2023-20198, CVE-2023-20273):

  1. A new custom header, ‚ÄúProxy-Uri-Source‚Äù, is set in the Nginx configs and checked in the `iosd` binary before allowing access to the wsma endpoints
    1. The attacker has discovered a method to pass requests to the `wsma` endpoints without control of the forwarded headers
    2. The `wsma` endpoints expects an XML payload and will execute any arbitrary IOS CLI command in it
  2. Updates to IPv6 address validation which is utilized in builtin software install functionality in endpoints like `/webui/rest/upgrade` or via `wsma`
    1. The attacker has discovered a way to write and execute arbitrary files by abusing this validation failure
    2. The software install vector also corresponds with the observed IOC in the Talos blog `%WEBUI-6-INSTALL_OPERATION_INFO: User: username, Install Operation: ADD filename`

Regarding the [#Cisco](https://infosec.exchange/tags/Cisco)
[#IOS](https://infosec.exchange/tags/IOS) XE web UI RCE vuln, I wanted to test
a few things in a lab environment to help with forensics, detection, etc. But
the software is [#proprietary](https://infosec.exchange/tags/proprietary) and
it seems Cisco tries quite hard to make it inaccessible to anyone not paying
them. So it's a challenge for
[#defenders](https://infosec.exchange/tags/defenders) to get some basic
answers from a device they control and know is not compromised.

blog post about the actively exploited zero-days CVE-2023-20198 and
CVE-2023-20273, stating that they identified a new version of the implant, now
called BadCandy, and added expected response from the new version of the
implant against one of the HTTP requests used to check for infected device.

 **Horizon3** provides "exploit theory crafting" after patch diffing Cisco's
IOS XE zero-day 17.9.4a patch (CVE-2023-20198, CVE-2023-20273):

  1. A new custom header, ‚ÄúProxy-Uri-Source‚Äù, is set in the Nginx configs and checked in the `iosd` binary before allowing access to the wsma endpoints
    1. The attacker has discovered a method to pass requests to the `wsma` endpoints without control of the forwarded headers
    2. The `wsma` endpoints expects an XML payload and will execute any arbitrary IOS CLI command in it
  2. Updates to IPv6 address validation which is utilized in builtin software install functionality in endpoints like `/webui/rest/upgrade` or via `wsma`
    1. The attacker has discovered a way to write and execute arbitrary files by abusing this validation failure
    2. The software install vector also corresponds with the observed IOC in the Talos blog `%WEBUI-6-INSTALL_OPERATION_INFO: User: username, Install Operation: ADD filename`

Regarding the [#Cisco](https://infosec.exchange/tags/Cisco)
[#IOS](https://infosec.exchange/tags/IOS) XE web UI RCE vuln, I wanted to test
a few things in a lab environment to help with forensics, detection, etc. But
the software is [#proprietary](https://infosec.exchange/tags/proprietary) and
it seems Cisco tries quite hard to make it inaccessible to anyone not paying
them. So it's a challenge for
[#defenders](https://infosec.exchange/tags/defenders) to get some basic
answers from a device they control and know is not compromised.

In case you missed it (because I did): On 02 November, **Cisco** updated their
blog post about the actively exploited zero-days CVE-2023-20198 and
CVE-2023-20273, stating that they identified a new version of the implant, now
called BadCandy, and added expected response from the new version of the
implant against one of the HTTP requests used to check for infected device.

Surprise announcement by **Rockwell Automation** : CVE-2023-20198 (CVSS **10.0
critical** , disclosed 16 October 2023 by Cisco as an actively exploited zero-
day) also affects their Stratix 5800 and 5200 managed industrial Ethernet
switches. No mention of CVE-2023-20273 because this advisory was published
before Cisco's update. No update since. Credit to

blog post about the actively exploited zero-days CVE-2023-20198 and
CVE-2023-20273, stating that they identified a new version of the implant, now
called BadCandy, and added expected response from the new version of the
implant against one of the HTTP requests used to check for infected device.

IOS XE zero-day 17.9.4a patch (CVE-2023-20198, CVE-2023-20273):

  1. A new custom header, ‚ÄúProxy-Uri-Source‚Äù, is set in the Nginx configs and checked in the `iosd` binary before allowing access to the wsma endpoints
    1. The attacker has discovered a method to pass requests to the `wsma` endpoints without control of the forwarded headers

  2. Updates to IPv6 address validation which is utilized in builtin software install functionality in endpoints like `/webui/rest/upgrade` or via `wsma`
    1. The attacker has discovered a way to write and execute arbitrary files by abusing this validation failure
