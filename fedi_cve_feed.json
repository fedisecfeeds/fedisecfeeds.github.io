In versions 8.8.1 and prior, a privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Notepad++ v8.8.1 installer that allows unprivileged users to gain SYSTEM-level privileges through insecure executable search paths. An attacker could use social engineering or clickjacking to trick users into downloading both the legitimate installer and a malicious executable to the same directory (typically Downloads folder - which is known as Vulnerable directory). Upon running the installer, the attack executes automatically with SYSTEM privileges. This issue has been fixed and will be released in version 8.8.2.",

However, this CVE expands the scope of affected packages in two ways. \n\nFirst, while the entrypoint for the vulnerability was the tika-parser-pdf-module as reported in CVE-2025-54988, the vulnerability and its fix were in tika-core. Users who upgraded the tika-parser-pdf-module but did not upgrade tika-core to >= 3.2.2 would still be vulnerable. \n\nSecond, the original report failed to mention that in the 1.x Tika releases, the PDFParser was in the \"org.apache.tika:tika-parsers\" module.",

An attacker may be able to read sensitive data or trigger malicious requests to internal resources or third-party servers. Note that the tika-parser-pdf-module is used as a dependency in several Tika packages including at least: tika-parsers-standard-modules, tika-parsers-standard-package, tika-app, tika-grpc and tika-server-standard.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 3.2.2, which fixes this issue.",

    "description": "## Description\n\nAn XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability was identified. The application accepts XML input through a specific endpoint ``/geoserver/wms`` operation ``GetMap``. However, this input is not sufficiently sanitized or restricted, allowing an attacker to define external entities within the XML request.\n\nAn XML External Entity attack is a type of attack that occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts.\n\nBy exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can:\n- Read arbitrary files from the server's file system.\n- Conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to interact with internal systems.\n- Execute Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by exhausting resources.\n\n## Resolution\n\nUpdate to GeoServer 2.25.6, GeoServer 2.26.3, or GeoServer 2.27.0.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe XXE vulnerability can be used to retrieve arbitrary files from the server's file system.\n\n## Reference\n\n* https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11682\n* XBOW-024-081\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis vulnerability was detected using **[XBOW](https://xbow.com/)**, a system that autonomously finds and exploits potential security vulnerabilities. The finding has been thoroughly reviewed and validated by a security researcher before submission. While XBOW is intended to work autonomously, during its development human experts ensure the accuracy and relevance of its reports.",

    "description": "### Impact\nThe Express server uses `express.json()` without a size limit, which can allow attackers to send extremely large request bodies. This may lead to excessive memory usage, degraded performance, or process crashes, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Any application using the JSON parser without limits and exposed to untrusted clients is affected.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is not a flaw in Express itself but in configuration. Users should set a request-size limit when enabling the JSON body parser. For example:\n`app.use(express.json({ limit: \"100kb\" }));`\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can mitigate the issue without upgrading by:\n- Adding a `limit` option to the JSON parser\n- Implementing rate limiting at the application or reverse-proxy level\n- Rejecting unusually large requests before parsing\n- Using a reverse proxy (such as NGINX) to enforce maximum request body sizes",

The implemented filter uses the function `has_meta_commands()`, which scans raw bytes using a regular expression. The regex does not treat the bytes as ignorable, so meta-commands such as `\\\\!` remain undetected. When pgAdmin invokes psql with --file, psql strips the bytes and executes the command.

During the transition from v4 to v5 an error was introduced into validation code which causes the validation of the previous password not to run as expected. This makes it possible for a logged in user to change their password in the back office without knowing the previous password. For example, if a user logs into their account and walks away without locking their workstation, an attacker could access the unattended session and change the password, therefore locking the legitimate user out. This issue is fixed in version 5.0.4.",

    "description": "### Impact\n\nBy exploiting the XSS vulnerabilities, malicious actors can perform harmful actions in the user's web browser in the session context of the affected user. Some examples of this include, but are not limited to: Obtaining user session tokens. Performing administrative actions (when an administrative user is affected). These vulnerabilities pose a high security risk. Since a sensitive cookie is not configured with the HttpOnly attribute and administrator JWTs are stored in sessionStorage, any successful XSS attack could enable the theft of session cookies and administrative tokens.\n\n### Description\n\nA request parameter from the URL of the login page is directly rendered within the Twig template of the Storefront login page without further processing or input validation. This allows direct code injection into the template via the URL parameter. An attacker can create malicious links that could be used in a phishing attack. The parameter `waitTime` lacks proper input validation.\n\nThe attack can be tested with the following URL pattern:\n\n```\n/account/login?loginError=1&waitTime=<a%20href%3D\"https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPhishing\">Here<%2Fa>\n```\n\nThe same applies to the `errorSnippet` parameter:\n\n```\n/account/login?loginError=1&errorSnippet=Reset%20your%20password%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPhishing%22%3Ehere%3C%2Fa%3E.\n```",

    "description": "### Impact\n\n`MySQLWriteTool` executes arbitrary SQL provided by the caller using `PDO::prepare()` + `execute()` without semantic restrictions.  \n\nThis is consistent with the name (\u201cwrite tool\u201d), but in an LLM/agent context it becomes a high-risk capability: prompt injection or indirect prompt manipulation can cause execution of destructive queries such as `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE`, `ALTER`, or privilege-related statements (subject to DB permissions).\n\n\n\n**Who is impacted:** Deployments that expose an agent with `MySQLWriteTool` enabled to untrusted input and/or run the tool with a DB user that has broad privileges.\n\n### Patches\n\n**Not patched in:** 2.8.11  \n\nRecommended improvements (even if keeping the tool intentionally powerful):\n\n- Provide a safer API that supports only constrained operations (e.g., `insertRecord`, `updateRecord`) with allowlisted tables/columns.\n\n- Add a policy/allowlist layer (e.g., allow only `INSERT`/`UPDATE` on selected tables; forbid `DROP/TRUNCATE/ALTER/GRANT`).\n\n- Add optional review workflow: log + require human approval for high-risk statements; or \u201cdry-run\u201d mode.\n\n- Document strongly that the tool must not be exposed to untrusted prompts without additional safeguards.\n\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\n- Do not enable `MySQLWriteTool` for public/untrusted agents.\n\n- Use a dedicated DB user with **least privilege**:\n\n  - no `DROP`, no `ALTER`, no `GRANT`, no access to sensitive tables unless necessary\n\n- Add an application-layer policy rejecting high-risk statements (`DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `ALTER`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, `CREATE USER`, etc.).\n\n- Implement authorization gating for tool calls (RBAC, allow tool use only for trusted operators).",

As a result, an attacker who can influence the tool input (e.g., via prompt injection through a public agent endpoint) may write arbitrary files to the DB server if the MySQL/MariaDB account has the FILE privilege and server configuration permits writes to a useful location (e.g., a web-accessible directory).

    "description": "### Impact\nAny user who can edit their own user profile or any other document can execute arbitrary script macros including Groovy and Python macros that allow remote code execution including unrestricted read and write access to all wiki contents. The reason is that rendering output is included as content of HTML macros with insufficient escaping, and it is thus possible to close the HTML macro and inject script macros that are executed with programming rights. To demonstrate, the content `{{html}}{{/html {{/html}}}}` can be inserted into any field of the user profile that supports wiki syntax like the \"About\" field. If this leads to the display of raw HTML, the instance is vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\nThis problem has been patched by extending the escaping introduced by [XRENDERING-693](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING-693) to also cover closing HTML macros that have spaces after the macro name in XWiki 16.10.10, 17.4.3 and 17.6.0RC1. A [similar fix](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/12b780ccd5bca5fc8f74f46648d7e02fa04fbc11) has been applied in `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore` as an extra safety net, see [XWIKI-23378](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-23378). At this point, we're not aware that this extra safety net would be required for security.\n\nThe patch also fixes the injection of opening HTML macro syntaxes, e.g., with `{{html}}{{html{{/html}}}}` which disrupts the rendering of the user profile but for which we haven't found any further security impact apart from the disruption of the UI.\n\n### Workarounds\nWe're not aware of any workarounds except for upgrading the affected module to a version with a fix.",

Versions 16.10.10 and below, 17.0.0-rc-1 through 17.4.3 and 17.5.0-rc-1 through 17.6.0 contain a REST API which doesn't enforce any limits for the number of items that can be requested in a single request at the moment. Depending on the number of pages in the wiki and the memory configuration, this can lead to slowness and unavailability of the wiki. As an example, the /rest/wikis/xwiki/spaces resource returns all spaces on the wiki by default, which are basically all pages. This issue is fixed in versions 17.4.4 and 16.10.11.",

    "description": "### Summary\nThe TIM (PSX TIM) image parser in ImageMagick contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in the `ReadTIMImage` function (`coders/tim.c`). The code reads `width` and `height` (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates `image_size = 2 * width * height` without checking for overflow.\nOn 32-bit systems (or where `size_t` is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if `width` and `height` are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via `AcquireQuantumMemory` and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read.\n### Vulnerable Code\nFile: `coders/tim.c`\n```c\nwidth=ReadBlobLSBShort(image);\nheight=ReadBlobLSBShort(image);\nimage_size=2*width*height;       // Line 234 - NO OVERFLOW CHECK!\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Memory Disclosure due to an out of bounds read on 32-bit systems.",

The issue arises from bdservicehost.exe\u00a0deleting files from a user-writable directory (C:\\ProgramData\\Atc\\Feedback) without proper symbolic link validation, enabling arbitrary file deletion. This issue is chained with a file copy operation during network events and a filter driver bypass via DLL injection to achieve arbitrary file copy and code execution as elevated user.",
