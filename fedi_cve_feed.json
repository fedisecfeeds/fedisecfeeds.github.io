To quote their Diversity Statement: \u201cNo matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community.\u201d They forbid discrimination against any person or group. Because it is a global meritocracy, you have contributors from every corner of the world. This diversity is actually a security feature because with so many different eyes on the code, it is much harder for a backdoor or a bias to slip through unnoticed.</p><p>For your \"backdoor-proof\" concern, Debian\u2019s Social Contract and strict adherence to free software guidelines mean every line of code is scrutinized by volunteers around the world. It is transparent by design. While no distro/OS is unhackable, Debian\u2019s slow and steady release cycle means security patches are thoroughly vetted before they hit your machine, reducing the risk of zero day regressions. Fedora has been vulnerable to zero day attacks in the past and will probably continue to be in the future. For instance, because Fedora is always on the latest versions, Fedora Users are often vulnerable to new attack. Earlier in 2025, the latest kernel which Fedora had pushed to users had a zero day vulnerability. Debian stable users did not have that vulnerability because they would not see that update for quite some time. </p><p>Sources: </p><p>Ubuntu Showing Ads in Terminal - <a href=\"https://linuxiac.com/ubuntu-once-again-angered-users-by-placing-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" translate=\"no\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://</span><span class=\"ellipsis\">linuxiac.com/ubuntu-once-again</span><span class=\"invisible\">-angered-users-by-placing-ads/</span></a></p><p>Debian Social Contract - <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/social_contract\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" translate=\"no\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.</span><span class=\"\">debian.org/social_contract</span><span class=\"invisible\"></span></a></p><p>Debian Diversity Statement - <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/intro/diversity\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" translate=\"no\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.</span><span class=\"\">debian.org/intro/diversity</span><span class=\"invisible\"></span></a></p><p>Zero day vulnerability mentioned -<a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37899\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" translate=\"no\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.</span><span class=\"ellipsis\">cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-</span><span class=\"invisible\">37899</span></a></p><p><a href=\"https://climatejustice.social/tags/Debian\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>Debian</span></a></p>",

    "description": "### Impact\nn8n contains a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in its workflow expression evaluation system. Under certain conditions, expressions supplied by authenticated users during workflow configuration may be evaluated in an execution context that is not sufficiently isolated from the underlying runtime.\n\nAn authenticated attacker could abuse this behavior to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the n8n process. Successful exploitation may lead to full compromise of the affected instance, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of workflows, and execution of system-level operations.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been fixed in **n8n v1.122.0**.\n\nUsers are strongly advised to upgrade to version **1.122.0 or later**, which introduces additional safeguards to restrict expression evaluation.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider the following temporary mitigations:\n- Limit workflow creation and editing permissions to fully trusted users only.\n- Deploy n8n in a hardened environment with restricted operating system privileges and network access to reduce the impact of potential exploitation.\n\nThese workarounds do not fully eliminate the risk and should only be used as short-term measures.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrust_binder: fix race condition on death_list\n\nRust Binder contains the following unsafe operation:\n\n\t// SAFETY: A `NodeDeath` is never inserted into the death list\n\t// of any node other than its owner, so it is either in this\n\t// death list or in no death list.\n\tunsafe { node_inner.death_list.remove(self) };\n\nThis operation is unsafe because when touching the prev/next pointers of\na list element, we have to ensure that no other thread is also touching\nthem in parallel. If the node is present in the list that `remove` is\ncalled on, then that is fine because we have exclusive access to that\nlist. If the node is not in any list, then it's also ok. But if it's\npresent in a different list that may be accessed in parallel, then that\nmay be a data race on the prev/next pointers.\n\nAnd unfortunately that is exactly what is happening here. In\nNode::release, we:\n\n 1. Take the lock.\n 2. Move all items to a local list on the stack.\n 3. Drop the lock.\n 4. Iterate the local list on the stack.\n\nCombined with threads using the unsafe remove method on the original\nlist, this leads to memory corruption of the prev/next pointers. This\nleads to crashes like this one:\n\n\tUnable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 000bb9841bcac70e\n\tMem abort info:\n\t  ESR = 0x0000000096000044\n\t  EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\n\t  SET = 0, FnV = 0\n\t  EA = 0, S1PTW = 0\n\t  FSC = 0x04: level 0 translation fault\n\tData abort info:\n\t  ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000044, ISS2 = 0x00000000\n\t  CM = 0, WnR = 1, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0\n\t  GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0\n\t[000bb9841bcac70e] address between user and kernel address ranges\n\tInternal error: Oops: 0000000096000044 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n\tgoogle-cdd 538c004.gcdd: context saved(CPU:1)\n\titem - log_kevents is disabled\n\tModules linked in: ... rust_binder\n\tCPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 2092 Comm: kworker/1:178 Tainted: G S      W  OE      6.12.52-android16-5-g98debd5df505-4k #1 f94a6367396c5488d635708e43ee0c888d230b0b\n\tTainted: [S]=CPU_OUT_OF_SPEC, [W]=WARN, [O]=OOT_MODULE, [E]=UNSIGNED_MODULE\n\tHardware name: MUSTANG PVT 1.0 based on LGA (DT)\n\tWorkqueue: events _RNvXs6_NtCsdfZWD8DztAw_6kernel9workqueueINtNtNtB7_4sync3arc3ArcNtNtCs8QPsHWIn21X_16rust_binder_main7process7ProcessEINtB5_15WorkItemPointerKy0_E3runB13_ [rust_binder]\n\tpstate: 23400005 (nzCv daif +PAN -UAO +TCO +DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n\tpc : _RNvXs3_NtCs8QPsHWIn21X_16rust_binder_main7processNtB5_7ProcessNtNtCsdfZWD8DztAw_6kernel9workqueue8WorkItem3run+0x450/0x11f8 [rust_binder]\n\tlr : _RNvXs3_NtCs8QPsHWIn21X_16rust_binder_main7processNtB5_7ProcessNtNtCsdfZWD8DztAw_6kernel9workqueue8WorkItem3run+0x464/0x11f8 [rust_binder]\n\tsp : ffffffc09b433ac0\n\tx29: ffffffc09b433d30 x28: ffffff8821690000 x27: ffffffd40cbaa448\n\tx26: ffffff8821690000 x25: 00000000ffffffff x24: ffffff88d0376578\n\tx23: 0000000000000001 x22: ffffffc09b433c78 x21: ffffff88e8f9bf40\n\tx20: ffffff88e8f9bf40 x19: ffffff882692b000 x18: ffffffd40f10bf00\n\tx17: 00000000c006287d x16: 00000000c006287d x15: 00000000000003b0\n\tx14: 0000000000000100 x13: 000000201cb79ae0 x12: fffffffffffffff0\n\tx11: 0000000000000000 x10: 0000000000000001 x9 : 0000000000000000\n\tx8 : b80bb9841bcac706 x7 : 0000000000000001 x6 : fffffffebee63f30\n\tx5 : 0000000000000000 x4 : 0000000000000001 x3 : 0000000000000000\n\tx2 : 0000000000004c31 x1 : ffffff88216900c0 x0 : ffffff88e8f9bf00\n\tCall trace:\n\t _RNvXs3_NtCs8QPsHWIn21X_16rust_binder_main7processNtB5_7ProcessNtNtCsdfZWD8DztAw_6kernel9workqueue8WorkItem3run+0x450/0x11f8 [rust_binder bbc172b53665bbc815363b22e97e3f7e3fe971fc]\n\t process_scheduled_works+0x1c4/0x45c\n\t worker_thread+0x32c/0x3e8\n\t kthread+0x11c/0x1c8\n\t ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20\n\tCode: 94218d85 b4000155 a94026a8 d10102a0 (f9000509)\n\t---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n\nThus, modify Node::release to pop items directly off the original list.",

    "description": "A denial of service vulnerability has been discovered in the resolv gem bundled with Ruby.\n\n## Details\nThe vulnerability is caused by an insufficient check on the length of a decompressed domain name within a DNS packet.\n\nAn attacker can craft a malicious DNS packet containing a highly compressed domain name. When the resolv library parses such a packet, the name decompression process consumes a large amount of CPU resources, as the library does not limit the resulting\nlength of the name.\n\nThis resource consumption can cause the application thread to become unresponsive, resulting in a Denial of Service condition.\n\n## Affected Version\nThe vulnerability affects the resolv gem bundled with the following Ruby series:\n* Ruby 3.2 series: resolv version 0.2.2 and earlier\n* Ruby 3.3 series: resolv version 0.3.0\n* Ruby 3.4 series: resolv version 0.6.1 and earlier\n\n## Credits\nThanks to Manu for discovering this issue.\n\n## History\nOriginally published at 2025-07-08 07:00:00 (UTC)",

The flaw affects appliances with the Spam Quarantine feature enabled and exposed to the internet. Atacks date back to late November 2025.</p><p>**If you have Cisco Secure Email Gateway or Cisco Email and Web Manager appliances, this is urgent: Immediately check if the Spam Quarantine feature is enabled and exposed to the public ports - if it is, disable it on all public ports until a patch is available for CVE-2025-20393. If your appliance may have been compromised, contact Cisco support and prepare to rebuild the system from scratch.

    "description": "Turms AI-Serving module v0.10.0-SNAPSHOT and earlier contains an improper file type validation vulnerability in the OCR image upload functionality. The OcrController in turms-ai-serving/src/main/java/im/turms/ai/domain/ocr/controller/OcrController.java uses the @FormData(contentType = MediaTypeConst.IMAGE) annotation to restrict uploads to image files, but this constraint is not properly enforced. The system relies solely on client-provided Content-Type headers and file extensions without validating actual file content using magic bytes (file signatures). An attacker can upload arbitrary file types including executables, scripts, HTML, or web shells by setting the Content-Type header to \"image/*\" or using an image file extension. This bypass enables potential server-side code execution, stored XSS, or information disclosure depending on how uploaded files are processed and served.",

Application uses the auth0/node-jws implementation of JSON Web Signatures, versions <=3.2.2 || 4.0.0\n2. Application uses the jws.createVerify() function for HMAC algorithms\n3. Application uses user-provided data from the JSON Web Signature Protected Header or Payload in the HMAC secret lookup routines\n\nYou are NOT affected by this vulnerability if you meet any of the following preconditions:\n1. Application uses the jws.verify() interface (note: `auth0/node-jsonwebtoken` users fall into this category and are therefore NOT affected by this vulnerability)\n2. Application uses only asymmetric algorithms (e.g. RS256)\n3. Application doesn\u2019t use user-provided data from the JSON Web Signature Protected Header or Payload in the HMAC secret lookup routines\n\n### Fix\nUpgrade auth0/node-jws version to version 3.2.3 or 4.0.1\n\n### Acknowledgement\nOkta would like to thank F\u00e9lix Charette for discovering this vulnerability.",

The issue exists in the subtitle download functionality, where user-controlled parameters are used to fetch remote content and construct file paths without proper validation. By supplying a crafted subtitle download URL and a path traversal sequence in the file name, an attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.",

    "description": "A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the omec-upf (upf-epc-pfcpiface) in version upf-epc-pfcpiface:2.1.3-dev. When the UPF receives a PFCP Association Setup Request that is missing the mandatory Recovery Time Stamp Information Element, the association setup handler dereferences a nil pointer via IE.RecoveryTimeStamp() instead of validating the message. This results in a panic and terminates the UPF process. An attacker who can send PFCP Association Setup Request messages to the UPF's N4/PFCP endpoint can exploit this issue to repeatedly crash the UPF and disrupt user-plane services.",

Most of H6056 devices have been successfully patched through automatic updates. Remaining H6056 users with upgradeable hardware versions must manually update firmware through the Govee Home app while keeping their device WiFi-connected. Users should open the Govee Home app, tap their H6056 device card to enter the device details page, tap the settings icon in the upper right corner, navigate to Device Information section (Firmware Version), and tap the Update button to install the security patch immediately.\n \nGovee H6056 devices with hardware versions 1.00.10 or 1.00.11 cannot receive firmware update due to hardware limitations.",

    "description": "urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. Starting in version 1.0 and prior to 2.6.0, the Streaming API improperly handles highly compressed data. urllib3's streaming API is designed for the efficient handling of large HTTP responses by reading the content in chunks, rather than loading the entire response body into memory at once. When streaming a compressed response, urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on the HTTP Content-Encoding header (e.g., gzip, deflate, br, or zstd). The library must read compressed data from the network and decompress it until the requested chunk size is met. Any resulting decompressed data that exceeds the requested amount is held in an internal buffer for the next read operation. The decompression logic could cause urllib3 to fully decode a small amount of highly compressed data in a single operation. This can result in excessive resource consumption (high CPU usage and massive memory allocation for the decompressed data.",

The vulnerability does not provide access to system-level resources such as operating system internals or privileged functions. Access is limited to device configuration parameters that are available in the context of the web application. The session cookie is secured by the httpOnly Flag. Therefore an attacker is not able to take over the session of an authenticated user.",

    "description": "JumpCloud Remote Assist for Windows versions prior to 0.317.0 include an uninstaller that is invoked by the JumpCloud Windows Agent as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM during agent uninstall or update operations. The Remote Assist uninstaller performs privileged create, write, execute, and delete actions on predictable files inside a user-writable %TEMP% subdirectory without validating that the directory is trusted or resetting its ACLs when it already exists. A local, low-privileged attacker can pre-create the directory with weak permissions and leverage mount-point or symbolic-link redirection to (a) coerce arbitrary file writes to protected locations, leading to denial of service (e.g., by overwriting sensitive system files), or (b) win a race to redirect DeleteFileW() to attacker-chosen targets, enabling arbitrary file or folder deletion and local privilege escalation to SYSTEM. This issue is fixed in JumpCloud Remote Assist 0.317.0 and affects Windows systems where Remote Assist is installed and managed through the Agent lifecycle.",

    "description": "Open OnDemand provides remote web access to supercomputers. In versions 4.0.8 and prior, the Apache proxy allows sensitive headers to be passed to origin servers. This means malicious users can create an origin server on a compute node that record these headers when unsuspecting users connect to it. Maintainers anticipate a patch in a 4.1 release. Workarounds exist for 4.0.x versions. Using `custom_location_directives` in `ood_portal.yml` in version 4.0.x (not available for versions below 4.0) centers can unset and or edit these headers. Note that `OIDCPassClaimsAs both` is the default and centers can set `OIDCPassClaimsAs ` to `none` or `environment` to stop passing these headers to the client. Centers that have an OIDC provider with the `OIDCPassClaimsAs` with `none` or `environment` settings can adjust the settings using guidance provided in GHSA-2cwp-8g29-9q32 to unset the mod_auth_openidc_session cookies.",

    "description": "Zerobyte is a backup automation tool Zerobyte versions prior to 0.18.5 and 0.19.0 contain an authentication bypass vulnerability where authentication middleware is not properly applied to API endpoints. This results in certain API endpoints being accessible without valid session credentials. This is dangerous for those who have exposed Zerobyte to be used outside of their internal network. A fix has been applied in both version 0.19.0 and 0.18.5. If immediate upgrade is not possible, restrict network access to the Zerobyte instance to trusted networks only using firewall rules or network segmentation. This is only a temporary mitigation; upgrading is strongly recommended.",

    "description": "Open Source Point of Sale (opensourcepos) is a web based point of sale application written in PHP using CodeIgniter framework. Starting in version 3.4.0 and prior to version 3.4.2, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the \"Return Policy\" configuration field. The application does not properly sanitize user input before saving it to the database or displaying it on receipts. An attacker with access to the \"Store Configuration\" (such as a rogue administrator or an account compromised via the separate CSRF vulnerability) can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into this field. These payloads are executed in the browser of any user (including other administrators and sales staff) whenever they view a receipt or complete a transaction. This can lead to session hijacking, theft of sensitive data, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim. The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.4.2 by ensuring the output is escaped using the `esc()` function in the receipt template. As a temporary mitigation, administrators should ensure the \"Return Policy\" field contains only plain text and strictly avoid entering any HTML tags. There is no code-based workaround other than applying the patch.",
